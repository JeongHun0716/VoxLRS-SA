big difference between byelections and general elections and in this general election for principal questions who do you want to be prime minister at the end of it now with
it's how people love each other and you know i'm a churchgoer too i don't have any problem in saying that i think the gay sex is absolutely
the steps that we're going to take the steps the prime minister believes that we need to take in order to deal with the
the european union until now has been assumed to have a better hand to play but the prime minister we now see has actually
as a deterrent if you know that you're going to have to put your council tax up to a referendum then you will be a little bit more respectful of people's money
well the critical question is can we give people the chance to set up new schools or the chance to change the management of schools where they're unhappy and if they take that opportunity then not only will it provide them with an opportunity which they've been denied so far it will also act as a goad and a spur to improvement elsewhere and if
yes i think that mrs thatcher was wrong in the way in which she starved local government of power i've got great admiration for many things that happened in the 1980s but one thing that went wrong is that we starved local institutions of the oxygen that they needed to grow and in that respect there were some other conservative politicians who were right
it's obviously going to be important to ensure that the rights of the irish people
we know that if you remove that on fuel then fuel bills will be cheaper than they otherwise would be ah otherwise would be
we if we left would have control of all of that money which means that not only would science not
a talented figure
i think that andrew did very well during the leadership campaign and of course having
well i have an open mind i mean part of the purpose of as i say in this conversation is to say how can we construct an immigration policy that allows people to come here to study and to work but in numbers that we control and that we can benefit from and if you are embarking on a policy commission and the explicit you know
and there were the british voters who decided that we should leave the european union and now i'm working with maurice glassman my friend a labour peer in order to make sure that we implement leaving the european union in a way that chimes with the verdict that the british people recall
hard brexit is a phrase that's used in order to try to make what is a liberation seem like a punishment but i do believe that we should be outside the single market absolutely and that's what people voted for
i don't know i think overall it was a mistake but the thing i did manage to get right was to argue that we should leave the european union and 174 million people agreed with me and therefore we now have as politicians an obligation to honour that decision to respect it and to implement it
wrong i think that the way in which the decision was
it certainly was not that is the accurate figure for the amount of money that the european union controls and i myself am in favor of increased nhs spending but since i'm not the health secretary or the chancellor of the exchequer i can't deliver that yet but we may be
no i think that that characterisation of things is
about grading and the curriculum that we wouldn't expect to be the
of what went wrong i think were visible to many of us one of the problems with education in england for many years now has been
the sorts of answers that we come up with reinforce what margaret thatcher once argued which is that the facts of life are conservative people want to see schools with good
that they have nothing to lose because they haven't been given this sort of moral scaffolding that allows them to tell right from wrong adequately
in terms of what the test of a good school is that sliding skill depends on the enthusiasm of the students that is the principal way in which i can judge whether or not a school is really outstanding the fact that people here are really keen to let me see them doing things that they love is a sign that this is a good thing
well i'm really impressed by the fact that people learn through doing
these are facts and these facts are also a story
who said that the pound rises the pound falls but britain is a strong country and that it will see its way through am i
because the european union is a big bureaucratic and unwieldy organisation that
are suffering as a result of our membership of the european union their wages are lower
well i've already pointed out to you a number of facts which you haven't denied
also also look at the facts of unemployment in southern europe youth unemployment in greece is
and in fact it's perfectly clear what we would do if we voted to leave the european union
want our democracy restored and who believe that britain should be a selfgoverning nation
my point is that i'm glad that all these organisations are not on my side
the working people of this country at last get a fair deal i think the people in this country have had enough of experts with organized
organisations like jcb which manufacture globally organisations like
more than £360 million to the european union we send £20 billion gross a year we get some money back but the money that we get back the rebate we cannot count on the rebate is decided at a european level it's not in the treaties it's not a guarantee and as the chancellor of the exchequer has pointed out that rebate can be altered to our disadvantage
all sorts of people would attack me personally but i love my country i could not recommend that boris was prime minister i had tried to make that work and therefore it would have been a genuine betrayal of principle and of this country to have allowed boris's candidacy to go ahead with my support
i made it clear that i did not believe that boris should be prime minister after having worked incredibly hard over the past
it's been laid out in some clarity in the newspapers boris had the opportunity to build a team boris had the opportunity to lay out a particular vision in the last 24 hours and i felt that he did not step up to that challenge and there was a deadline
my political life i've asked myself one question what is right for this country and if there is a personal cost to me i will bear it
is not interested in doing is spreading home ownership and he made that perfectly explicit well we think that it is right that we should spread home ownership at the moment it's not fair that if you live in a
we do because over the last five years we haven't reduced spending in supporting people who have disabilities i think the idea that any government led by david cameron would actually make the lives of disabled children or families with disabled members more difficult simply doesn't
is a democrat and a patriot to his bootstraps when we had a vote in the house of commons on intervention in syria in the last parliament the vote went against what the prime minister argued for and what i believed in
well i completely disagree with alexander tomerko on that again as i mentioned earlier i'm a free speech guy i respect the rights of people to
all of us would want our daughters to grow up to be like she was an amazing person and i can only grieve for her and in particular
what it would be would be an affirmation of faith and hope in britain and i think that britain would be taking its place alongside countries like australia canada new zealand and america as a selfgoverning democracy democracy is one of the great gifts
i explained that i didn't think that the situation would arise
but i don't think that we politicians should mark our own homework i think it's important for us to outline what we believe and then let the people make a judgement
absolutely i struck up a conversation with her at the time and had a few subsequent conversations
politicians including theresa may have said that at the moment they don't think that's right in particular i in the course of this debate have pointed out that president erdogan the president of turkey has been taking his country in a direction which i don't think is aggressive
who run daily risks and as justice secretary i think of prison officers those who work in our court system and police officers as well while i've been justice secretary there have been horrendous assaults against prison officers and of course there's been the murder of a police officer as well on merseyside
just that so for that reason i strongly support theresa in these negotiations and as prime minister and i do agree with david that the stronger her hand the better the deal that she'll be able to secure for britain
sometimes there would be a request from the media that you might want to accept in order to appear but your first priority was to get things right in your own department to talk to those people who were responsible for delivering services and to make sure that patients or in my case parents and pupils came first
yes i am last year of course during the the tumult of the leadership election i put myself forward and
these people are the same ones who got consistently wrong
i don't think it is because one of the striking things about this debate is that those who are arguing that we should remain have a vested financial interest
i could not be prime minister i'm not equipped to be prime minister i don't want to be prime minister
i think boris is entirely entitled as the mayor to speak up for london he was elected on the basis that while he was a conservative to his bootstraps he was also someone who when he felt that the city would benefit from having an independent voice he'd be that independent voice
that in 2015 students will start studying for these examinations and in 2017 they will sit them for the first time will be more than enough time and people can prepare now for the sort of change that we're going to make
one the bbc understands very well between being a reporter who allows a politician to speak for themselves as you're doing now and an individual who can form a judgement about what they say
well i think that they require very very different skills but we've got a very good prime minister at the moment in theresa may and a very good ambassador in kim daedak
approach involved both the times and bilt and the presidentelect thought it was a good idea to talk to britain's best newspaper and the most successful newspaper on the continent of europe
well we asked specifically whether or not he would stand by what is said on nato
no no no no i like being a member of parliament for surrey heath and i love writing for the time
i didn't watch it but i heard about it i was surprised that boris had decided to withdraw actually at the time
a talented figure but of course i lost and there you go and i think the thing is that if you are defeated in any election
economy there are some people including the former governor of the bank of england mervyn king who argued that sterling was overvalued beforehand and it's certainly given a competitive edge to our economy but there were lots of commentators yourself included adam who were
gloat all i would do and have done is point out firstly that there were lots of people during the run up to the referendum who said that britain's economy would be plunged into recession that hasn't happened there were lots of people who said that we would see a flight of capital from this country that hasn't happened i think in the papers today glaxosmithkline had recorded
to trust me i'm asking the public to trust themselves i'm asking the british public to take back control of our destiny from those organisations which are distant
it's a real figure which we've already had
my point is that i'm glad that all these organizations are not on my side i'm glad
policy isn't in the hands of the british people i think that we should take back control so that people like you and others can debate and decide how many people can come here
take away vat on fuel if he left the european union one of the problems about being in the eu is that you can't once vat has been slapped on a project
is the ingenuity the creativity and the strength of the british people many of those who are arguing that we should remain are trying to frighten you by saying that it would be impossible for britain to
every week we send actually more than 350 million pounds to brussels
but you mustn't inhale the truth is that i prefer i prefer
was born and brought up in scotland i'm i consider myself to be scottish and british at the same time and i'm proud of our united kingdom its history and its traditions and one of those
and that has meant additional pressure on accident and emergency and additional pressure on gps as well
can achieve amazing things if only we trust the next generation
to strengthen and to reinvigorate our democracy because our democratic tradition
the leave campaign is not an alternative government the leave campaign are a group of people who believe that the government that we elected a year ago should take this country out of the european union
that the european union is growing slower than every continent in the world apart from antarctica it's a fact that if we vote to leave and we take back control then we can shape an economic policy which is in our interests britain's been strong in the past and can be strong in the future
and june the 24th if we voted to leave then we're in a different world as far as relations with these countries are and i think that they will recognize our democratic vote
on fuel to heat and light their own home i've said if we leave the european union
you've had your day unelected unaccountable elites i'm afraid it's
this debate but it's perfectly clear the legal basis is that if you're ordinarily resident and you've got legal right entitled to a property in another european union country then that will be respected and you can enjoy
the working people of this country at last get a fair deal i think the people in this country have had enough of experts with organisations from acronyms had enough of experts the people of
weakening our border controls so that we cannot keep out criminals and we cannot kick out terrorists there have been detailed proposals
here in london in the world and i think that we're uniquely fortunate to live in the best country in the world and it's because i think this country is so great and because i believe its people are so wonderful
making sure that our children grow up with wider horizons i think it's critically important to make sure that we have a balanced approach towards immigration because our country has succeeded in the past by being open by being inclusive by being a united kingdom
nicola sturgeon because she's a very effective operator but what i fear is that if we have nicola and alex salmond determining what happens then we will have the government of the united kingdom shaped in the interests of only one part of the kingdom rather than all of us and i think that would be a mistake
steve i can tell you i'm absolutely not um the one thing i can tell you is that the
well britain will be in a position as any sovereign independent nation is where it can set the taxes and set the rules
leave take their jobs with them go next door and start polluting at will better to have them here creating the jobs in an environmentally sound responsible place where they're going to pollute last
we're consulting about that now i mean the climate leadership team did a fantastic job
community as heather scott says a community response to a community need so it's really it's and it's easy for people to get engaged at share donate some food
so many things that people can do that will make a real difference for people be a big brother or a big sister and provide some guidance in a child's life one thing that we know is that for children who struggle and who may not have a positive adult influence in their life it just takes one adult
the creation of jobs and opening up government and opening up government is all about listening to people so this is a really good example of where we can start listening to people
yeah i mean i don't know the answer to that either i think that we're going to take our lead from the community as much as we possibly can on that i know that our burritum is important to people and i know preserving that green space is important to people to the extent that we can
to be pretty frank about it because i've known joe for a long time but you know that's what he's decided to do so you know i guess i guess if he's a new democrat now that's what he is
do that i think we can enable the creation of more jobs for people and that means that more families are working and that means that they'll be giving to share rather than relying on share for support
the stress of worrying if you can make your mortgage or your rent next month the stress of wondering whether
should know and it's i liken it to a dinner table you know we're going to
we had the former chief economist of the bank of montreal come in and say
you know that's always been a part of campaigns i mean i don't know if anybody looks back at abraham lincoln's campaigns but there was a lot you know i mean so it is it's part of and i think in general we live in a less civil society i mean and my example of that is reality tv
and the people who work in film really matter and they make a big contribution but getting to a balanced budget only two provinces got to a balanced budget in the whole country that was us in saskatchewan and you don't get there without saying no to a lot of very very good causes things that in good times when the economy is not so fragile you'd have no problem supporting
this campaign we are not saying the same thing and i think that that's going to raise voter turnout
i think we all have an obligation to be a little bit more civil not just in politics
because i don't regret my time in politics at all not one bit but at the same time though i sure love the quality of life that i've got back from being in the media
you can go to the people and you can say you shouldn't be firing me
you'd find a lot of opposition to across the country because for us the thing about a car you know there are three things about the carbon
has been really supportive of that he phoned mr obama about it they've spoken he's going to raise it again when they meet at the state dinner so i'm confident that the attention is there we've just got to start getting some words on paper so that negotiation can really get going in earnest
well we had our fourth consecutive balanced budget we're the only province that's triple a rated now in canada we're eliminating our operating debt and 19% of people voted in the body
no delays they are really enthusiastic about making our lng dream in british columbia come to life
quebec which is the only other province that has a carbon tax now is at about $10 a ton and we're at $30 so that's great but there's still a gap there
was never to say and we want these conditions to be so impossible to meet that we're really saying no the company has adopted the five conditions
there are 150 coal plants 150 on the books today in china that are going to be built the only way we're going to stop the next 150 is if china gets
which is great they added one which we're totally comfortable with and most importantly for lng
well no i mean it's good for the federal government to be including a broad range
i think we can look forward to an equal future and i think that's important because one of the most interesting things for me about becoming premier has been the number of mums and particular dads who have come to me and said i'm glad we've got a woman premier
some of it really difficult to take some of it appropriate some of it inappropriate it's just the nature of the job and you know if you can't deal with that
i want people to know that on this truckers issue our primary motivation has been to fight for truckers we want to start taking control of some of these federal jobs because we think we can do a better job for truckers
our commitments i mean it's been a it's been a difficult road partly because
no pillow no blanket that's it and for him to sit there and see someone who every day spends her entire day trying to figure out how to get enough stuff to get through the next day was absolutely life changing it wasn't an easy vacation
it could have been and you know we didn't we didn't set the criteria i'm sure it was very difficult for the federal government to figure this out
a south asian representative to that board and for heaven's sakes when i had a chance to appoint somebody and i looked at the ethnic makeup of that board what a gla
trying to make sure that we can find consensus and that's really what we needed because you know the problem at the port when the federal government has been running it has been that the truckers had no one to go to no one to fix their problems no one to mediate and it was just whatever the federal port said that's what happened
they have put those criteria on their website they're fairly complex i mean one of the choices they had was to say
so things like for example whether or not the trucking reform
people depend on these jobs to support their families and they need to earn enough money to be able to build a future that's why people come to canada so i'm really committed to that the trucking community south asian community has been an incredible supporter to me many many friends in the community and i want to make sure i am a friend continue to be a friend and fight for this community
about a number of different things that we heard from the community you know really trying to be a conduit for the voice of truckers and that was one of the things that we heard but environmental
it's a luxury that many people don't have to be able to think about the future that you want to send your kids to school
we haven't really been in control of the decisions that they've been making so it's been kind of a little bit challenging for us but i think we've gone in there we fought for the truckers as well as we could as hard as we could and i think we got the truckers a pretty good deal out of the changes that the feds were making
you know the federal government put that up on the website we didn't get to design what the criteria were it was their decision now remember though they were going to make these changes
anybody who knows india will know india is a very cosmopolitan in many places very very wealthy country but it also has the largest number of poor people of any country in the world i mean 12 billion people
as hard as they possibly can and we don't want to add to their burden we want to try and take that away a little bit
homes so the home program which would give up to a $37000 no interest no payment loan to people to help them get into their first
build government homes that people will never own and then give them a subsidy to try and stay in those rental homes forever what i think people want and what they want for their kids is they want a chance for their kids
going to fix them you know when i got here that was one of those issues that was on my desk when i arrived and one of the difficult things about this year has been in particular the issues with clvc because people with developmental disabilities
know there are there are strong arguments in favor of regionalizing police forces there are lots of
certainly will be on vancouver island but is victoria airport high enough on that list in terms of generating economic activity the transport the people that work in our government and the transport ministry say it's just not
so the thing about the jobs plan is it's addressing all those areas of the economy that are most important on vancouver island
because i went and got the premier's job before i got the mla job i now have a fulltime job well a more than fulltime job so what i'm trying to do
that is a really important thing if you want to do a good job as an mla representing the community i mean it's not just about getting elected and then doing what you want which is i think you know might be what we see
the first record i ever bought was a prism record which my brother broke over his head
fingers record this morning because i was trying to refresh myself for our interview today and i was realizing i don't know any of the words to any of the songs
and my son goes to a catholic school and i say to him you know every day he says a prayer at the beginning of class and i would say sweetheart hamish i want you to pray today
again the trade needs to go in both directions so british columbians need to come here and make investments in the philippines too
another big one for us is medical technology and pharmacy
we want to go where the opportunities are for british columbia british columbia's economy is the fastest growing in canada and the philippines is one of the fastest growing economies in the world
english is the language of business is the language commonly spoken which makes it a lot easier
arm and offered me a glass of water i'd probably have said thanks
to make choices for their children and so you know if we don't have a range of choices if we don't allow independent schools or we you know and we don't we can't provide any choices for people so our public school system is excellent it is one of the best in the world and the best in the country no question about it but you know it's not perfect
the ndp numbers so of course they're going to say that and it's not true since we introduced the bc jobs plan in september 2011 we've gained 32000 jobs so that's the statistic that's the number
financial meltdown a global crisis that defied anyone's predictions and so all around the world we saw governments running up huge deficits getting themselves in deep deep trouble in british columbia we actually managed
that has allowed us to get closer to opening new mines in the province 17 new and expanded mines is our goal we're halfway there to allow us to be able to move on this liquefied natural gas opportunity we're very close to making that happen and all of the things that we've done in trade
and so i try and be straightforward even sometimes when people disagree with me but i think that's strong leadership and you know adrian dix taking all the
them and that is one of the most rewarding things that you can ever get to do
and so you know it's just politics i think but i do think you know
i'm going to give you a vote and then once you vote i'm going to respect what you say which is what i've done and so now we've gone back to the old system and i think you know there's one thing that people i hope know about me it's that when i say i'm going to do something i stick with it and i'm determined not to do it
potentially five pipelines and five liquefied natural gas plants on the coast i mean you're talking about a
so we have i mean it could be a bridge it could be another tunnel we haven't even really gotten to the stage the concept stage and nailing that part down so we're going to go and talk to
for young people but it won't just be issues with respect to affordability of housing there will be a range of measures that we will be following
that in the budget we have measures to address some of these issues that have been raised
we are all very familiar with the numerous and regular requests we get from the opposition for an independent public inquiry on every matter that comes before the legislature
to do the work that we're looking forward to doing this session as we start a new chinese new year
don't let's get rid of it and then let's do what i think all party leaders should do and i would encourage the ndp to do this as well which is ask instead for reimbursable and expenses
oh i drink my coffee with a little bit of milk and espresso
there were three people charged three people were charged and two of them were convicted
i'm the premier british columbia and i'm not the most vulnerable woman in the province and i have a platform to do it
i had to stop thinking that what had happened to me was
when we talked about that that women don't come forward to report sexual violence because they don't think it will be taken seriously
because that bill it moved me to do it and you know that when i saw the bill
they said like almost all of them had a story some of them really bad really bad stories way worse than what happened to me
it doesn't have to happen young people don't have to give up lose their lives they don't have to commit suicide because they're being bullied because we know how to stop it we just have to do more and we haven't done it yet
because what the treaty does is it sets up a framework almost a language for discussion
a similar thing happens with municipal governments each of us know what we're supposed to do and what we're responsible for funding and supporting and we have a forum then
some of the most entrepreneurial one of the most entrepreneurial first nations in the province is the niska and i would argue the achievement of their treaty was really what enabled that blossom
but we have a chance this year to have another 1984 it seems to me these people are high stakes and something could happen particularly in the first debate that upsets this race pretty dramatically
the most recent poll there shows mason dixon shows a two point lead for clinton but if you look at the other two polls there one shows a two point lead for trump florida atlantic university and a one point lead for trump the florida chamber of commerce but those are
but not necessarily in more than one state he sort of made the bet that he's going to try and be he's going to be the guy who he's counting on trump collapsing and him inheriting his people which is why he doesn't say things bad things about him goes out of his way to say i'm saying nice things about him it's pretty cynical and i suspect that trump has got that this is a guy who really does it who's counting on him
republicans are not going to win this next election by finding a missing magic cash of conservative voters who have heretofore loyally supported us but were turned off by those arch liberals john mccain and mitt romney that simply is a myth it's sort of like trying to refight the civil war as a lost cause
but there are candidates who can plausibly win the nomination bush
to defeat donald trump they know that's never going to happen it just is not going to happen it is more insidious and more dangerous in a way and that is to undermine the people's ongoing confidence in the presidentelect now i've been through this once before i remember people like paul begala and others out there in 2000 and 2001 saying george bush is not a
i have no idea well look we know where these things come from these come from the nationalists the populists inside the white house who say we've got to do something to increase jobs and the way we do that is a big makework project we've got to increase spending on infrastructure look i'm a little bit conflicted on this my fatherinlaw has been the head of the white house
will i think look there's a good chance we don't and it's because you've got that's a disaster
end of september and it had a 20% increase in discretionary spending the republicans blocked him from passing a full year budget trump comes in and what does trump do he says more defense more homeland security less on things that i'm not in favor of
first of all let me say i enjoyed the segment with you and judge napolitano where he questioned your accent we understand you down here just absolutely crystal clear it's napolitano
the president has the biggest megaphone and if we want the focus to be on jobs and the economy and prosperity and making the country move again he needs to set the tone and instead it's so personal with him you were talking about commencement addresses well
he had a right to re to to fire jim comy and rod rosenstein the deputy attorney general laid out excellent reason
yeah look let me go back for a second they did have talking points i got a copy of them but the question is whether they got them into time and when they had
the labor department regulations and other regulations had a serious impact and obamacare of course ripping up their balance
i'm going to keep going fine but i'll be happy to answer the question please do look i thought he'd get close i thought he would win florida i thought he'd win
and it wasn't until 2012 after he'd lost control of the house was in a reelection battle and had little enthusiasm for him his campaign and the latino immigration community that he finally issued the daca order
and sort of tried to make it the summer of his campaign a big deal so the president has a little bit president obama has a little bit of a weird relationship to this issue he claims to be an advocate but when he had a chance to do something about it he didn't
of paid family leave they stood up and applauded on nato they joined in when they should
well you know what i've got to check the chart and see what it takes to put personal references to other pundits in my column there's a chart i have to have to check on that i'll let you know what the bill is and send it to you
and you could tell it affected his delivery a little bit he started reading almost exclusively from the panel to his left which allowed him to look at the right side of the chamber which were the republicans but the democrats you're right they stood up and applauded
been waiting on average 230 days to get a determination whether or not they were eligible and covered by the va
991 one of the reasons why is one of the biggest blocks of votes out in the state are the republican suburbs inside hamilton
presidential elections we had one where they were tied on labor day 2002 obama won one where somebody was behind george w bush in 2000 and went on to win but in the other seven elections
then the best thing for him and for the president is for him to say mr president better that you never ask me those kind of questions better that you never raise the issues in that way so if it was in the gray area he had an obligation to say something to the president i think if it was not in the gray area and it had crossed his line then he had an obligation to say something inside
incorrect or improper to be asked that he should have said to the president mr president with all due respect i don't
he said in that conversation do you think he could let this thing with flynn go we don't know whether or not it's accurate that the way that comey remembers it is accurate but it would seem that if the president said that and comey
if it was improper for president trump to say in the oval office hey let this thing go i think you have to apply that same standard and say it was inappropriate for the former president to while he was in office while the investigation is underway to say hey she hasn't done anything wrong in essence signaling to the fbi drop it
about items to go in the stimulus bill and he cut them off by saying i won basically shut up i won sit down this set a bad tone and this tone has continued and a president has to be open to and legislators have to be open to reasonable compromises recognizing the ideological constraints of their party and the nature of the of the city
we've always had strongly ideological figures in congress ted kennedy for example and barry goldwater
so people can take their benefits with them from job to job and not be stuck in a job they hate for fear of losing their job
in the last three years the tone that the president has said have made this more difficult when the president in early
effort by democrats starting on july 15th of 2003 to say bushlight about wmd in iraq the first five people to make that charge and the 15th it was
i understand why arizona did it because it's the weak point on the border and they've got all kinds of problems with drug related primarily drug related violence
but even he said some of it at wmd and was a threat he said we can just take care of it by something short of four
in the primary and having the support of the president of the united states helps you there
really good i mean that said the book has done quite well the publisher is very happy with it
well bush deserved to be impeached over there what did bob graham deserve to have happen to her so to me it was one of the great i mean it was so cynical in a time of war let's undermine confidence in the commander in chief so we can win election i thought it was despicable
this could be career people at the at either in the national security council or the state department who might have access to this as well
entirely there's another part of the new york times story though that is troubling
that was do you think he was trying to pressure you to drop the investigation and if
great pressure because of russia and that's taken off that's sort of like the
us you know it's discouraging and demoralizing
you know don't be very careful with the president's credibility and don't create moments you go in and talk to chuck schumer and nancy pelosi and say i won the popular vote except for those illegal aliens of course they're going to go mock you to the press
and then we had an interesting moment in the communications world where sean spiljak
is that you got it all wrong i mean you know for example that last one that was actually a nutty college
iraqis had attempted to acquire uranium cake in fact we now know that he brought back information not disclosed in his article that added to the belief that confirmed the british intelligence report that the iraqis had attempted to acquire uranium cake he brought back information about a previously unknown contact where the iraqis working through a third
but my recollection is that i said i heard that too
one of the interesting stories is going to be why at this moment and it may have been that this was the only moment that you know they may have been boxed in by the rest of the nato leaders so this was the only moment where the president had the stage to himself i'm sure that he would have preferred to have said this it's something other than a memorial to victims of 911 and you know it looks sort of odd
a 911 vote difference 4917
when it was at 74% it was 20 some odd thousand votes now with 77% of the vote in it is 991 one of the reasons why it's one of the biggest blocks of votes out in the state are the republican suburbs inside hamilton county
and for example right now we just showed 22 million or so thereabouts for each one of these guys the secretary of state shows 2473492 for obama to 2443901 for romney now the gap which was 911 whenever this
even if they have made it on the basis of select precincts i'd be very cautious about intruding in this process
that'd be about a million two people out if you look at cuyahoga county 414000 votes have already been cast last time around 668000 were cast so somewhere around 260000 votes would still come out of cuyahoga county
supposed pseudo cage match began is now 29906 for president obama but it's you know we still have 700000 votes or more likely to count and so the question was at a point when the secretary of state's website was saying 911 votes difference we were raising the cautionary note whether it might have been wise just to wait a little
let's go back why was this why why did the space cowboys raise the issue because at the time that we did it the numbers being shown on the fox
425000 were cast last time around about 220 yet to be cast in that case
to let us have two of the morally unfit people i mean this is the kind of guy he is
this is what caused the senate democrats to lose their majority in 2014 it is a good thing for american democracy that this man is retiring to searchlight nevada it's not too soon for me january 4th can't arrive too early for harry reid to hit the road
and the explosion of social media which is created if you will a class of people inside the united states who are focused on receiving information up to date uh ed realtime and are engaged in this the question is how much of
he said he said moment but let's assume for a moment that president trump said
when it was at 74% it was 20some odd thousand votes
it is 991 one of the reasons why is one of the biggest blocks of votes out in the state are the republican suburbs inside
secretary of state website i got the director of the ohio campaign harami on the other end of the line refreshing the page every few seconds and this went from being
and we now are starting to see the suburbs start coming in then we have big swatches of butler county delaware county
let me let me just say it wasn't the clinton people it was the gore people and i'm confident the president obama's staff is not going to uh stoop to that president clinton i suspect was horrified when he found out what some people had done
we shared common friends so that when he would come to the white house we'd chitchat about those common friends
to subsidize their lifestyle and to put themselves in a place where it looks like a conflict of interest
he was so it was so totally unexperienced totally unqualified and immediately was forced to resign but what was he this year he was a super delegate for hillary in philadelphia
well it's not unusual for somebody to spend a considerable block of time with the president but i think there are very few presidents who spend hours with somebody in the oval office particularly a blowhard like joe biden was i mean this guy is i've seen him in some meetings when he came to the white house
absolutely absolutely there would be a note taker in the room i thought it was interesting andy card who was the chief of staff said he
this whole issue of calling states on the basis of exit polling is something that needs to be taken
or maybe they were quoting some of these same three people twice and one person defended the process
now fleshing it out matters but they said let's emphasize prosperity what have we done to
let's talk about us following through on what we said during the campaign put in a rule for
look he has done really well in these meetings with foreign leaders what i hear back from the foreign affairs community is that most of these foreign leaders say wow i had a productive meeting
the leaks against the administration i counted up in one washington post story 11 negative quotes about things going on in the west wing from 9 at least 9 staffers in the west wing and then we got of course friends some of them who are real friends and some of them who are styled as friends who are
if he ever gets the credit for that all right karl grove thank you very much my friend have a safe weekend
during the primary season we had all these candidates herman cain looked great rick perry
and if not by that point then you're gonna have to kind of retool
it would be presumptuous for anybody to leap to any conclusions like that
where things go and it will sort itself out over time i have no doubt but it will sort itself out based upon the best ideas we have under republican management that are appropriate for the future of this country
to get ready for criticism because america has been a world leader for a long time we get criticized we're always at fault we're always to blame everybody's always pointing a finger of blame at us and i used to tell them you're now on the world stage folks people are going to start criticizing you and you better get used to it
you know if you love this country you serve this country every time i've been asked to serve over different administrations from reagan to the two bushes to president obama
so what did you find in 1972 that was so significant as a result of dr kissinger
their international forays are based on economic pragmatism
transcendent foreign policy issues that are on the horizon that may take our involvement like weaponization in iran what do you do when iran all of a sudden develops a weapon of mass destruction over the next year to year
can this happen it's a very proud tradition you have here in the granite state and it's just a wonderful honor to be able to get a little glimpse of it early on
this is an exhilarating experience and i was comparing and contrasting it with where we've been for the last two years in china where you can't very well go into somebody's home and talk politics and expect the media to show up and write and comment any way they choose and expect neighborhood people to show up and ask whatever question they want this is so americana to be able to
and i wasn't about to change my position on it is the shrillness of our conversation on immigration not only is heard by the hispanic latino community but also by the latino community
you could build baseballsized stadiums to process visa applicants and you're still never going to keep up with the demand
sometimes people on the outside can see you better than you see yourself and what some of your strengths and weaknesses are
the company that carried our name i was involved with my dad with my brother who's now
create a little bit of momentum and people after having heard you enough in terms of your rationale for running
would show up in some cases 50 would show up
i think in republican politics it's less about personality everybody likes to play the name game
my life needed to go at that point which is as much about helping others as it is learning about yourself
get down to today's leaders and i think in china many of the emerging members of the fifth generation see north korea as a major irritant they have a they have an economy now to manage the chinese do they didn't have much to lose in the early days if things went south but they have they have a real economy to manage these days
nothing not predictable there but it will also be one of some collaboration and opportunity
economy and that would be regional security how you deal with north korea and iran and that would be i think if we get really smart about this relationship in the years to come how do we together pool our brain power that
and that's going to continue so i have every confidence that the field will be shaken up time and time again we're going to stay steady and consistent and base everything we do on common sense and pragmatic solutions
reciprocal beneficiary rights some people don't agree with me some people attack me for it but i happen to think it's the right thing
factor of china and i guess i know the relationship i've lived in asia four times and i've tried to crack the code on china for 30 years
to their people and they rise up and they do something about it you can't blame israel for that this has become a fairly
i come from the most polluted city in the world beijing mostly traditional pollutants not all co2 but a lot of traditional pollutants
i know that there's a body of wisdom out there that says
is happening we can identify sources and people who know this well they can begin to think through what the solutions are
to make it all happen so not just for me but a need for our entire family
and about openness and about human rights and about the role of the internet in society you can't stop that and the party is saying what do we do if we don't make accommodations if we don't make some changes and give a little bit in terms of liberalization we can see a headon coalition by 2015
interview that we've just had is among my very favorite in recent memory so thank you
and 90 million bloggers who are having conversations unprecedented in china's history about reform
it's msnbc it's fox it's republicans it's democrats
now in certain parts of the country like new hampshire it's heroin but in our part of the country it's methamphetamine i say how can we lock away these
so when i had to turn the radio off with my 10yearold daughter recently
and that is make your best argument put down all the data
both there is no process for independence to have a convention in which
our sentencing commission we were just talking with the dean and some of the others about what we did
our problem is this as soon as the election ends in november because politics is such big business now for the media it didn't used to be they're gonna start some format
your party not of your faith not of your belief system to figure out a way forward
they fell into the trap of addiction my sister died of addiction and i saw it up close and very
do all the right work and you can actually win the election technically but the electoral college process is somehow not going to go your way because there's just no way to deliver
there and we have a number that is equal to the number of seats in congress the democrats do the same thing there is no such process for an independent
now think about that for a minute we've always had the ability generation after generation to take what seemed to be insurmountable problems world wars depression
very important environment that the entrepreneur works within that is going to make i think
the connection was complete i knew she was ours that bond of love and affection just happened instantaneously
when it was put on the table and the white house called
for me that was a very very important lesson in politics because i ran on a very specific platform
my years as governor it was always the interaction with people that stood out as either the most gratifying or the most heartwrenching i guess because i'm a people person more than anything else and you feel the pain you feel the pain of people in your state when they're going through it
the world but the second part of this we haven't done enough to ensure that we have a competitive
from what i've heard based on the 2014 plan i haven't heard anything beyond the 2014 plan
i don't think the nation is ready for that and i think it'd be the worst possible thing we could do when our nation needs to begin to grow that is not a progrowth strategy we found that in our own state of utah
that i think is absolutely needed in today's environment you've got to understand the environment in which jobs are created it helps having been governor and rick's been a good governor and he's a good friend on top of that but it also helps to have been in the private sector where you actually are working with the banks and customers and suppliers in making a company go and that i have and i don't see a whole lot of other people
it's an 1800 mile border you've got to work with the four border governors in terms of getting their verification that in fact you've secured the border
nature of american politics in the earliest phases these days and that's the part that has to change
about us growth so on and so forth but you look on the stage at people
and so that huntsman guy seemed pretty unhot bound he's a republican i think i could support
how do you sentence bois filles because you need a party plenum in order to do that based on party rules
so their numbers recently represented 20% of us retail sales one company
in employment patterns so the rise of structural unemployment
sovereign debt problems banking problems and growth problems
because i think they frightened asean with their deployment patterns in the south china sea
substantive debates which was the bane of my existence because you get 30 seconds to talk about
and he said that huntsman guy he said he's actually a republican i could vote for
8 9 10 percent maybe 7 8 9 percent which will cause an uptick in unemployment which maybe will have an impact on direct investment foreign investment it may have some impact on social
when you make comments that fly in the face of what 98 out of 100 climate scientists have said when you call into question the science of evolution all i am saying is that in order for the republican party to win
of leadership coming up i think they get this part and you can only hold back people so long before you have to come up with a longer term internet strategy openness strategy that i think is consistent both with the political implications which are very real but also with the economic development implications and i'm guessing in the head of xi jinping
power is consolidated i think then reforms begin
and there are going to be technologies that work their way around whatever barrier you throw up
to get lee ray huan out of the politburo and so we're going to see changes every step of the way but i'm guessing we'll be with seven members of the standing committee
and then the head of yu zhengsheng and then the head of zhang dejiang
as a team sport we either get in and we lead and we do the job or you don't get in at all i also think that we're in parts of the world
this is a pretty historic place we remember in 1980 at the beginning of the fall general election campaign the president came here it was a time of difficulty and trouble in our nation and he basically promised people that we could restore our greatness again and he did so today i totally stand in his shadow
it's failed you have as governor or as president about two to two and a half years to do what you can do in order to fix the economy or to do what the american people elected you to do we're now roughly at the end of the day
authority figures proper deference and responsibility and i also care sean because the rest of the world is watching the rest of the world cares about how we conduct our affairs
it was a oneoff deal because she had a boyfriend i don't want to get into this kind of romantic detail i'm not sure it's important at all but i was successful once my junior year in landing a date and beyond that it was a hardfought battle all the way to when i think i was 21 or 22 years of age and we felt a lot of pressure
so our philosophy has always been we didn't start with anything so we're going to end life with nothing you leave it back you figure out some way to benefit
we're living a whole lot longer than we were in 1935 when social security came about so a combination of moving the retirement age and maybe indexing the underlying numbers to cpi
probably the beatles or the rolling stones since they were at the cutting edge of rock and roll at least during my generation
in my father's family that if you did it right you would rise up and become an educator like my grandfather you would serve in the navy which is what he had done and his three sons all did the same thing so my father was involved in the navy just right before the vietnam war
i'm proud of that we're running on my record not running from my record they're not going to find a lot of political shenanigans and a lot of political theater i don't do that i find solutions to problems in a pragmatic and conservative way
just as we are in a static world that is completely unrealistic and again i think that's a very important point
on goofy statements like that give me a break that's gonna make electing a republican very
well the us congress including myself strongly supports
and my concern would be that additional sanctions right now would simply strengthen the hand of the hardliners in iran who do not want an agreement in fact in my view that plays into the hands of people who do not want an agreement
could not be a pathway to developing nuclear weapon and nuclear weapons capability we believe that the heavy water reactor at iraq
forward but i think they've made it clear as part of the interim agreement that they
to the extent that we can resolve these matters at the negotiating table in a way that's satisfactory then that averts the possibility of other kinds
making sure that iran does not obtain a nuclear weapons capability and again i want to emphasize the fact that everything that's
which is why there's great concern people look at the iranian nuclear program and say what could iran possibly want with this huge enrichment infrastructure and so any agreement would have to dramatically dramatically limit that enrichment infrastructure
we want to make sure that that statement genuinely reflects
well my position has been that we should give the negotiations a chance but i continue to believe that sanctions are a good thing
system that ensure that that doesn't happen
unless there's an agreement and the very limited sanctions relief that exists
ability to enrich nuclear material so that it could be
and so if that's the iranian position then why not
i think there have been very important improvements in the pakistaniamerican relationship in large part because the pakistani government has begun to take actions
about the management of this program it was worth pointing out to the american people that had they had their way you wouldn't have had the $2 billion for it in the first place
so this is the entity that was set up by the federal government to encourage
and if the money is not being well spent that program should be canceled but for the most part those funds have leveraged private sector funds and contributions to help nonprofits that provide important services in the communities i mean we're in montgomery county
which was i think a great experience growing up with people from different cultures you really try to learn to put yourself in their shoes
need help and support just to go about their daily living in many cases
more recently they developed the peace corps response program it's a little different than the traditional program where you just have volunteers who don't necessarily have a lot of skills and background they have some but not
so much and it's important that people give back so i think
and going into a hut where it was very dimly lit and there on the wall of the hut was a portrait of president john f kennedy and the reason that portrait was there was because president kennedy launched the peace corps and the peace corps had provided important services to that village in terms of better sanitation
law from way back with legislation that kept the best
that they've got and depending on the nature of the crisis they can deploy them but it's not only crisis deployment now but that is still a big part of it
providing affordable care to about 18
so to speak there is servegov you can go there and that creates a whole menu of options that people can search so servegov here in montgomery county there are lots of service opportunities and there's also an organization or a sort of
absolutely i mean we still have to make progress on some of these big budget issues
and around the globe you know it's been 14 of the last 15 years
sure well first let me say something about the peace corps because it's a great program opportunity to serve
americans are a big hearted people and they really do want to give back to their community
and i have always been one that has tried to work hard to reach across party lines
nonprofits that are already based locally that already understand the local challenges and americorps volunteers provide just a little bit more knowhow there's a sort of a paid staff person who can then encourage more volunteers
offense and that has been the big story of this election rather than circling the wagons and just protecting our gains from last time we've stayed on offense and so in addition to defending i hope at the end of the day about 20 we hope to be on offense in up to 50
abortion quick because i want to move on the facts are not one penny of taxpayer money goes to planned parenthood or anybody else for abortion and what mike and his colleagues tried to do was use a
but now we still have people graduating with these huge debts so i have proposed along with people
2008 and 2006 election we picked up 55 seats in that period so that's where you begin to look but there are also other races where we have members who have been here for a longer period of time and so we're taking nothing for granted that's why your question is hard because we're going to take nothing for granted we understand that this is a difficult political environment
issue that they're going to go after certain democrats on democrats in districts where they've had a consistent prolife record and will continue to have a prolife record it is very disturbing to see that
was give consumers additional powers and strength visavis insurance companies it helped rein in the insurance companies and if someone wants to argue that we should let them loose again and let them discriminate against preexisting conditions for kids that's a tough argument
to the school lunch program that's not my figures those are the congressional budget office figures
hit everyone and everything else harder that's just simple math
here in the united states the president and the previous congress enacted a number of
and it was a failed approach there it would have been a failed approach here fortunately at the critical moment we were able to pass the economic recovery bill which did stop the freefall and turn the corner
constitutional amendment to balance the budget is the right way to go because what it does
that key question of balance so far been missing from the conversation when we sit down with our republican colleagues
indicated that the recovery bill helped to save or create up to 4 million jobs
our debt to gdp ratio on a stabilized basis at the end of the decade
cuts but also revenue to prevent the sequester from taking place for a year we actually didn't even get a vote on it but
of deficit reduction now that's not the way we want to do it there are better ways to do it just like there are much better ways of dealing with the
careful not to say it would end medicare it would radically change it and it would end the medicare guarantee and this is how it would do it currently under medicare you're assured a certain amount of support from the medicare program to meet your health needs
to various agribusiness interests around the country we also said that we should get rid of the subsidies for the biggest oil companies so we took a more balanced approach unfortunately our republican colleagues rejected
also have over 16 percent unemployment in the construction industry it simply doesn't make sense to have that kind of deep cut especially when the congressional budget office estimates that about one third of our current year deficit is as a result of underemployment the fact that the economy remains somewhat weak
responsibility and shared prosperity now on both these two fronts
current deficit problem is because there are too many people out of work so absolutely our priority has been to get people back to work and i mentioned the republican joint economic committee report cut and grow that was the same prescription that
longterm economic growth now the budget math is pretty simple if you refuse from the outset
we need to build a strong relationship between the united states and the united states
howard berman many of us worked on that legislation and we need to continue to expand sort of
and that goods made within those zones in pakistan would have dutyfree access to the us markets
somebody who's worked to put progressive ideas into action and on the table versus someone who just votes the right way
candidates in this race and the washington post and others have endorsed me and one of the arguments is that we want people who are going to take progressive ideas and actually
mcconnell has made no secret of the fact that he's playing what i think is a very cynical political game and so hopefully after this election season you know republicans will come forward and help participate in moving this country forward rather than just standing on the
gingrich who the other day made some comment to suggest that you know the president was some alien
thinker and he had the kenyan anticolonialist approach to the world look these are efforts to try and say the president is not one of us it's a very cynical
what it is they understand that we need to come together as a country to finally pull ourselves out of this economic challenge and that it doesn't make sense to have people making such calculated efforts to undermine the president of the united states in the sense of trying to make him appear like some alien being
big oil subsidies for oil and gas companies that are doing
an agenda for change to keep working on the economy we're going to need to have a substantial majority in the congress but we'll see i mean there are some signs there that if they were to continue
well first those races are really focused on local and state issues they had a big debate in new jersey on how to
sustainable for people who have health insurance right now we know their premium
to move us forward but it does tell you that they have not put any answers on the table i mean if you look at the health care reform debate they put forward
who can't afford any health insurance at all so it was a big night it obviously goes over the senate side we're hoping very much
they get this thing done so that we can get a bill to the president's desk by the end of this year
virginia we know had a lot of local transportation issues there were two other very important races on the ballot last tuesday that focused on federal issues those were congressional races we had one in california we had one in new york state and in both cases democrats won in the case of new york
the areas that it's they're targeting will result according to the congressional budget office in 750000
because clearly we have a white house and a president who are not realitybased you have a president who tweets out totally unsubstantiated allegations
distract people from the ongoing investigation between the trump campaign and the russians but this administration has been trying to interfere with that investigation and now you have the president
that everything is being said for the first time and i think it's one of the great gifts that an actor has to have but it's probably underappreciated because
they just say well this is it what do you think what do you think what do you think and what i would find that because i have done this very many times and audiences some people would sit there and say oh it was lovely it was funny
well here we go and the english cast was saying oh did they laugh at this in a minute
the gym otherwise you're cheating yourself and the audience and everything you've got to tell every step of the way and that is the
the city added up so it became another character whereas on the stage we talk to the audience we explain the thing and the abstraction we chat with them
i've gotten from an audience of test screenings whatever and the same thing happened and it happened i did in london i was in an english company english director proceeding the stage as opposed to an arena stage everything was different and i really thought i probably
as opposed to a child all this stuff well they get up in the morning they gotta move they gotta clean they have to organize this political this they're chasing each other they have snakes when they come home at night i mean it's all that
great that's all together now he doesn't mind he always says to me where have you been where are you going which is which is what martin says to me in life
and so we started reading and i remember the script says enters laughing and crying hysterically that was where i had to start from and they were like you know kicking it around and saying what they'd done last night and stuff like that and believe me they were talking about what they'd done last night
i tend to morsel with these two guys
you think oh i can only do one thing i only have a narrow channel and it's great when you say no i still can be flexible and morph myself into other characters say that might
and that state of mind i think is adjusted slightly because now you get kids who think they want to be in show business they don't necessarily want to be an actor and when times were very dark for me i suppose that i said
reworking but anyway so i got a call from lincoln center and from john saying would you come we're doing this little play it's just six weeks limited engagement with the mitzi newhouse
some things the best work i've ever some of the best work i've done has been a very obscure endeavors that didn't you know break through that membrane and these days especially
did work on it pretty hard and so now i'm sort of proud of the fact that these kids like rizzo so much
the first time which is pretty difficult but that's what the approach was
you know you have to be real has to be something between you which then as an actor you control because you're either on a stage or in front of lights and you have to move your head a certain way so that weird balance of control and improvisation as i mentioned
project that thing that wakes you up in the middle of the night and says oh wait a minute i know what that's about i know what that moment's about because that's really what makes it worthwhile you know that's the living part that's the being alive part
like canned beans not being able to be fresh not being able to have the enthusiasm for the next
he used to write to these different instruments and he probably did that to me and i didn't even know it but over time he said to me the second time i saw him
and that's how it came out we were having lunch and he went back that afternoon and wrote that script that made martin have his character have ms and maybe his doctor and that c that underground slot point went on for seven
because it's such a tiny part but it turned out that we did it and martin and i
and taking this real trip and the guy into the 330 of the am of the soul it's really about that and how you come back
you know you're acting in play it takes up a lot of time but it's a success but now i'm hoping that i can do more stuff on film
i think i've probably seen grease less than any other human being on the planet
late seventies when i made it he made a movie and it worked or it didn't it was a big hit at the time
i was the kid that would have to wear those long sleeve oxford
she's like most first ladies her own person i mean you wouldn't compare hillary to laura i mean i don't think they do it so why should i
you know and everything behind the scenes that goes on with it having said that um
speech does that people her friends said that i did i did judy shepherd better than judy shepherd
in the summer i think it was 1990 and then they were going to move it up to the beaumont the big theater upstage at lincoln center and it got tremendous instantly had tremendous spotlight upon it and you saw people in the audience who you knew were sitting
you weren't already a motion picture actress i would never do this i would never jeopardize my piece and fred m skepsle did the same thing and it was just an amazing leap of faith
the wider of six degrees separation but i had just finished a play by neil simon that had the dubious distinction of being the first and only to this day neil simon play to close out of town before
where there's an audience there you suddenly had a sense when the audience was responding to it that this bizarre play that seemed to be so inchoate on the page and it's so difficult to know how it was gonna communicate how to life it just touched an audience in some way in its most comedic ways and its most serious way
by the time we opened it just went through the roof and so this little thing i thought was going to be six weeks of my life ended up being four years of my life
about three months later aaron got the right idea of making me a doctor and also brought up the whole issue of the ms situation which was completely off the top of his head as far as i could tell but that's how he writes that's how he does things and then it started and that was five years ago
you know break through that membrane and these days especially it's really the luck of the draw whether you're gonna you know break through
much aware consciously aware that that was the process that was going to happen and i also was aware that he wouldn't let me off the hook
supposed to land right away because that was just an accidental thing that happened it was lovely you know so there was a great deal of comradery and just
piece that's about people who are on death row and were exonerated etc
she wanted me to be married well and raise children which is a perfectly responsible thing to do but instead i ran off and joined the circus
yes he did say that to me and it was definitely a criticism of how i was looking when i walked out the front door
long and great and terrific but i had a wonderful time doing it taught me a lot and i was working with people i became extremely close to in my life so it was extraordinary
and then back okay and then stuff that's there that said we have a what a grandchild a grandchild
because we had known each other for like 30 years and so we found this marriage building up these relationships
and it got in there by the skin of its teeth and pat birch fought for it and i think bronte and i don't know and i think the director as well i mean but it's in there and i'm so grateful that it is
i felt odd about it now i kind of love it i mean it's and i also i love her i always loved her it was more you know at that time i couldn't get interviews with people because they i was in something that some literati glitterati had you know dismantled
it is how the theater works i mean you have your rhythm of the day and
anyway there were two of us down to two of us i'm not gonna mention the other person because you'd all be stunned and amazed and think of nothing else
well that's kind of what that experience was like it was exactly what that experience was like
and i'm down stage and whoever's playing the boy is up stage you know you don't even see each other
i think i spent the entire time in the hotel room reading this damn play
can you come to san francisco and replace someone so then we went to la and da da da da da
now i doubt very much if anybody in this audience could sing choey for me but i sang it for galt mcdermott and john guare and joe papp and i think they thought it was so absurd they said oh give it to me
oh you know stuff is really going on there which i thought was definitely part of the character because she's not just you know some woman in a store buying a guy a suit
bernie jerry and bernie sat there and sort of went well my dear
you know it's not quite as clear cut as her being this monster and him the angel climbing up the stairs because he was ready to do her in
and sometimes it would take me i'd get it right away sometimes it took me a while and i said i'm not challenging you i'm really trying to figure out how to do this properly for you so it was you know it ended up i thought wonderfully i loved it but it was a whole other way of approaching something
the funnier it is we should just tell you about the sadism of comedy that's what people
dating shows crack the whip and you have three people going around and you have to add one and then you have to add one and then you have to add one until you've got twenty people
you know have a little altar up there in my brain
i made double my salary because my salary was like scale on overtime doing this thing i didn't have time to think about it i just was thrown into it and it was so
and we all sat around in living room and read it and it was hilarious it was funny but you thought oh great it's great to sit in someone's living room and read a play
the arc of it has shifted a little bit because i realized how strong
huge lovely raves from papers and then but it took us four years to get it on broadway because richard didn't want to do it and jim dale ended up doing it and it turned into a wonderful thing short lived
i once said this before so forgive me i said i felt like a cat with two big dogs
and said i mean you know we're just closing in a week and don't you guys wanna do it i was it was shameless
at the bottom i was at the bottom of the barrel bottom of a drawer maybe you know but i decided the only way i could do this was to look at her like she was just a real person and i was so much older than she was in life but i couldn't
it's wonderful arvin also memorized every word of the script we sit there in the audience and
changes i like reading things absolutely cold and that's often how i got jobs i mean i've been fortunate enough over the past million years not to have to audition
that is just a very familiar romantic comedy that's just not that interesting and it should be made by
if you've got three people on a stage and they have a relationship if you have a twohander which are really tough because everybody has to learn their lines right away to just even get near performing but at least you've got
elaine may and i did it in boston because the people with the theater company boston they knew my work and they put me in it
of precision it taught me a huge education in how you have to be patient with letting a performance evolve because the whole play was evolving it was being rewritten etc and in the end jerry and i ended up in this relationship where if you remember there's a long speech
everyone actually such as last monday i go out and point out the problem that needs to be addressed and the medium term threat to the australian economy everyone says oh great that's the problem what's the solution well actually you need to explain why you are undertaking reform
for the carbon tax so there's already been a round of tax cuts
saying to the australian people it's alright don't worry we don't have to undertake any reform she'll be alright well she won't be alright
that's the challenge every government faces well i mean that's up to the us but so far he hasn't had great success and you never know hopefully he can do what he wants to do as president but we all face those challenges but we've got to do what we believe to be right for the nation and he's doing what he believes to be right for the united states
in a competitive process that's what the prime minister said we're currently going through through national security committee and through budget committees we are going through the proper process of evaluating who has the capacity to build the submarines in what is an extraordinarily short period of time because the previous government didn't have the courage to make the decision
we cannot continue to go on borrowing $100 million a day as a government just to pay our daily bills because if we continue down that path we are going to leave future australians with a lesser quality of life and i'm not going to pass the buck to future generations to pay for my quality of life today
no not at all we are at a tipping point for the nation
given we have an enormous economic risk associated with our gas pipelines all around the coastline
so what we want is for that unemployed person to get a job and the best chance of them getting a job is someone else is earning taxes in creating business making profit if you do that then they've got a chance of getting a job
the process promises i want to talk about the jobs we're creating i want to talk about the infrastructure i want to talk about what we're doing to build a stronger nation
i don't accept that i don't accept that because the money is a supplement for that
everything we spend in this budget is being paid for by prudent savings in other areas
madam speaker a nation that lives as a family must help to strengthen its support
this is an exciting frontier for economic development that is filled with abundant resources and talented people
specifically excluding fly in fly out and that saves three hundred and twenty five million dollars we are limiting fringe
as a result we are allocating an additional $35 billion to reform the childcare system
create new jobs that is why we will ease the financial strain by allowing business owners to immediately deduct the costs incurred when starting up a new business or receive tax relief when restructuring
our border protection policies have stopped the boats and they have saved lives
everyday australians rightly believe that if a dollar of profit is earned here then you should pay tax here
from a $48 billion deficit we inherited to $35 billion next year
are doing more to help the level of youth unemployment in australia is too high
so tonight i announce this government will invest more than $330 million to help young and disadvantaged australians get their start
the lowest small business company tax rate in almost 50 years most small businesses of course are not run as companies so we will also give an annual 5% tax discount of up to $1000 a year for unincorporated businesses we are the only business in the world that can be run as a company we are the only business in the world that can be run as a company
if we could lift our services exports like higher education tourism healthcare and financial services to just half of our population
and overwhelmingly it's going to be privately funded and this is the thing barry australia is very good at publicprivate partnerships take tollways or private investment in public transport we are very good at it we have the technology and the capacity
obviously repairing the mess that labor left on the budget is a significant issue and i wish the labor party would take the same bipartisan approach in relation to fixing the budget
well i spoke with the finance minister of russia only yesterday we had a lengthy discussion i certainly shared with him my views
ongoing positive growth particularly in the asian region but even in aggregate around the world
as does the prime minister and i think the australian people would welcome that as well but barry we have to pay for this
you're ignoring the fact that tony abbott announced an extra $4 billion on top of the 12 today i announced an extra $8 billion of recurrent cuts and on top of that had substantial savings in the capital account by not proceeding with $18 billion of borrowing on the nbn and $4 billion from the proceeds of the sale of medibank private
they'll deliver one in three years time well quite frankly following their performance in the first three years we don't trust them
now if martin parkinson's speech or statement says that that money is
so it's not the silver bullet for the budget nor is it the silver bullet for the economy what we've said is whatever you put in place needs to be sustainable we don't believe the revenue from the mining tax is sustainable and we also don't believe that if you fund the company tax cuts out of the mining tax it will not be sustainable
and if that's the case then that's all the more reason to go for growth which is a speech i gave last week which is all about economic growth which is the big challenge for global economies how do we get growth going in the absence of fiscal stimulus and in many countries where monetary stimulus is pretty benign
cuts across the public sector we've been very upfront about that i mean what other political party has ever had the guts to say we are going to reduce the public service by 12000 employees when we are elected what other political party has had the courage to lay down as we did at the last election
structural growth expenditure against a diminishing
oppose the mining tax package and then devote in favour of company tax cuts that are paid for by that mining tax
and bob the issue here is the government's last release data says that they are going to have a surge of $34 billion in extra taxes in the next six months
costings by press release the day before the election on the afternoon before the election wang xuan didn't even have the courage to front up to stand by his numbers before the last election now the irony is that when treasury after the election disputed our figures
that are going to facilitate greater opportunities overseas and there is no doubt
is on a slow growth but it's not as volatile as company tax receipts and what's happening is that the government says and it's public pronouncements it's still determined to get to surplus next year
having said all of that what we've said is that we will reduce government expenditure we will make savings within government that will fund personal income tax cuts
i'm not seeking to be popular i'm seeking to do what's right for the country to get the budget back in the surplus to pay off labor's debt
earlier if that's the biggest issue to come out of today then i'm really concerned about it because we outlined today a comprehensive economic plan
our economic action strategy is not about cutting government spending it is about spending less on consumption and more on investment so that we can keep making decent and compassionate choices in the future
for those who leave the workforce to have children we want you to have every opportunity to return to your career
$36 billion towards the improvement in the bottom line so i want to emphasise that the budget we announced tonight is the first word and not the last word on budget repair there is still much work to be done
to construct 15 major new teaching hospitals every year
thresholds for the private health insurance rebate and most medicare fees will also be paused
will help change that culture by providing a payment of up to $10000 to a business that employs an australian over the age of 50
to existing levels of funding through the national health and medical research council
over the last decade we have been blessed with a mining boom in the highest terms of trade in 140 years an amazing 80% of all investment in the recent mining and resources boom has come from new foreign investment in australia
not delay aging but delay the aging process and
ultimately entitlements come from the pocket of another taxpayer so from our perspective
we were never interested in supporting the malaysia people's swap we were never going to do it and we are not going to do it
well it takes too long everywhere but if people deliberately tear up their papers or obfuscate about their originating circumstances then in a sense they can
claims from a number of different countries in relation to andrew wilkie
that's guaranteed if your employer does not give you that money but if they do then it's meant to be a safety net
it was going to $667 billion
well no it isn't it's actually giving australian small businesses some of their own money back to invest in new plant and equipment that is going to create jobs
down and when you get a deficit down to zero and you start running surpluses that's when you can start paying back debt now i if i can just answer
that through a free trade agreement australia can get some proper redress
it's only under the new coalition government the abbott government in australia that real progress has been made
it reflects the fact that there is only a very small percentage of land in queensland that is foreign owned and by far the largest investor from overseas in land in queensland is from the united kingdom followed by the united states
well you'd need to deal with them on a casebycase basis if it exceeds the threshold of $15 million but it is actually quite rare to have a single property that is worth more than $15 million i mean that is a very substantial property
well i'd just say to you andrew it's so important to be careful and prudent with expenditure today to ensure that you don't have to make hard decisions tomorrow and this is why we've been constantly critical of the government
and give them flexible and affordable childcare you're going to see more and more women drop out of the workforce and that's going to have quite a significant negative impact on this
we have spent a lot of money for example on national security australians expect that we have to find that money we spent a lot of money on defence in order to deal with the threat
entrepreneurs take advantage of this marketplace and utilize it in ways that we never would have dreamed i don't think i would have come up with the idea of buying and selling used cars on ebay you know as you said from beanie babies to used cars
the users are doing and then enable that we think of ourselves as a marketplace steward
buyers want to be where sellers are and sellers want to be where the buyers are it is an incredibly compelling environment and difficult to start another market the analogy i often use is a new york stock exchange and nasdaq it's very hard to create another stock exchange today because the action is on those two exchanges so there you know the analogies i think are good in that regard
not that the concept isn't a good concept in japan it's as relevant in germany as it is in canada as it is in australia but we were not first to that market yahoo japan was first to that market
you can go immediate go to halfcom you'll see ten or twenty or a hundred books of the one you're exactly looking for john gershwin's the brethren and you can see what prices people have listed those for and you'll see what condition they say those books are in and then you pick your right mix of condition and price
this is when you come in to work every day there are decisions that have to be made where they've never been done before because we created this entirely new marketplace there are challenges every day that you never would have entered
world at managing this kind of marketplace and making it a fun place to trade for millions of years
and he was interesting he was an ebay fan he loved ebay but he said you know i'd like to be able to buy it now the immediacy and convenience of fixed price and so that's why
we are making a profit we have put up terrific numbers our market cap has held up i think the best really of any internet company out there most internet company stocks are down 80 to 90 percent and i think the viability of the business model the trajectory that we're on and the results that we have delivered have protected us from the dire downside
listen i always say if you cannot name the problem you have no hope of
but in the end it was probably better for him great for bain and actually was a big learning
so we've got our best people thinking through okay what is the hp play in that part of personal compute smartphone or its next incarnation
comes off to be a tablet to full scale tablets which we're introducing we just introduced our first android tablet
so there's no question that we overpaid for autonomy because there were accounting improprieties so it's a smaller less profitable company than we were led to believe what i will say is we are very committed to the autonomy technology and to the
political favors do you think jerry brown is going to stand up to the public employee unions if they've bought and paid for his entire campaign
in la or a big company like intel every financial incentive is to go to an oregon or a nevada or a colorado then i want to streamline regulation you know i've been to now almost all 58 counties
about jerry brown and this is a story i admire when the state was in tremendous financial difficulty he said you know what we're going to do we're going to take the cell phones away from all the civil servants in the state of california and i remember thinking okay that's all very interesting but it is 001 percent of the budget
from healthcare to education to transportation to retail
we're doing with microsoft azure docker and arista to up
for each individual business unit there is a very coherent customerfocused strategy and productfocused strategy so i'll give you one example so our printing business listen we are betting on ink but we are betting on printing
we need to tell the street hp story we need to explain business unit by business unit what our strategy is where the growth is going to come from what the products or services are going to come from
exactly it's all paid on a credit card and those funds immediately go to the september 11th fund the twin tower fund and several others that may be added over the course of the 100 days we've waived all of our fees visa mastercard discover have waived their fees so if your lamp or your old set of skis or your tennis racket goes for $100 all of that money goes to the relief fund
the initial two funds were recommended by governor pataki and mayor giuliani and that is the twin tower fund and the september 11 fund and over the next hundred days we will work with various leaders in the government to decide if two or three other funds should be added from a technology point of view we have the ability to have five funds benefit from these proceeds
end after a hundred days it happens to end actually on christmas day is the hundred days so i think we will end at that point but we will keep going
so i don't think we know this is all becoming you know clear what route would you take to get those deficits in line
costs and frankly the biggest problem for california is it's going to cost the state an extra three billion dollars to cover this federal health care program at a time when we simply can't afford it you know we're facing a twenty billion dollar budget deficit over the next 16 months how we're going to absorb another three billion is not at all clear so i think this is the wrong thing at the wrong time when we're in the middle of a recovery
so he has no interest in fighting it through any means and so i think he's quite happy to have this you know rain down on california
and we cannot afford that kind of tax cut right now not on top of a $20 billion budget deficit so what i want to do is get people back to work
targeted tax credits to get hiring going cut government spending and then turbocharge the economy by an acrosstheboard tax cut but you have to pace and sequence this smartly otherwise you will increase
and i think he doesn't understand the very negative effect this will have and he has not outlined a plan to turn california around and he has not outlined a plan on how we're going to pay this incremental $3 billion
so i think we have to look beyond the normal
i'm a big believer in focus if you go to sacramento with too broad an agenda you'll be stymied
service employee unions and his chief of staff gray davis gave away the store and we have an inability to pay $100 billion of unfunded liability so here's what we have to do we've got to increase retirement ages from 50 to 55 for public safety
dollars a week in unemployment benefits in california so we're in a financial vice so that's why i'm actually here in orange county today talking about how we're going to put californians back to work and reduce that unemployment rate i've got a plan to create two million new private sector jobs by 2015 and that's absolutely essential
billion unfunded liability between pension and healthcare and what happened of course is when jerry brown was governor he gave away the right to collective bargain to public
finally across all businesses we've stepped up our focus on customers this year alone i've met with more than a thousand customers and partners and the entire company is focused on reconnecting to our customers and partners i can tell you nothing is more important
in softwaredefined networking we launched a new app store that coupled with our network developer kit will create the industry's first enterpriseclass open ecosystem
voted against those tax cuts is they were not accompanied by a decrease in government spending and what you can't do is you can't
keeping those tax rates low is incredibly important but i think the main reason that john
education crime and jerry brown has refused to put out the first proposal on how he wants to fix the state you know he often says i don't like tenpoint plans right now i'd settle for one great idea on how he's going to fix california because he has no concrete plans and i don't think californians are going to put up with it
because we've got to give businesses more cash flow to invest in their business this is an incredibly difficult time for businesses like mag instruments sales are down foreign competition is up and we've got to give these
jobs overseas and to other states or we can say you know what we are not going to lose another job from california and we're going to be the very best place to start and grow a business so i'll be the chief sales officer for california
100% against tax increases on hardworking californians we are overtaxed that is not the issue the issue is we are not running the government efficiently so we've got to cut $15 billion of spending from the state budget which we can do and frankly i believe it will make california stronger not weaker
i want to eliminate the state capital gains tax we're one of a handful of states around us
longer have to pay sales tax on the equipment they buy to manufacture in california
small and it's not just the trading volume on ebay it's the sheer scale of the company 13000 people
and so that's the first thing the second is and this i learned from politics when you are trying to win hearts and minds of a big company like hp
that's a very good question so listen i think how you win hearts and minds and how you become a trusted colleague is the same when you're the ceo as when you're a new person and that is do what you say you're going to do
is jerry brown and gloria allred what's going to happen to nikki after november 2nd whether i win or lose this election
we didn't we fulfilled our obligation as an employer to let her go but we decided not to make an example of her
what it means is that we will always work through the cio to help solve your all's problems so i bet many of you will
queries from your marketing department what can i how can i use some of these new technologies listen we
have control of the technology in your enterprise i can tell you as a cio i mean as a ceo i do not want everyone in my organization buying technology it has to be coordinated
now for those of you who have made investments in our software business please rest assured that we remain fully committed to you
with an average 12 hour flight time can produce 8
of over 800 it and business executives globally and 80% agreed that digital transformation is a reality for their business right now
hp inc the pc and printing business from hewlett packard enterprise the data center business we spun off 51 percent of our business in china that was called h3c to xinhua university which is one of the great universities in china my conclusion was better to own 49
voltage and then of course the most recent announcement was separating es from our core business and remember
looking for a budget and here's what we've got to do in order to solve this budget crisis we've got to put californians back to work the only sustainable way to increase tax revenues is get the economy going and then we have to take $15 billion of costs out of the state government because unfortunately we have a government we cannot afford
so i'd say that sam blakeslee won the president zero and you look at bob mcdonald's race in virginia
look at chris christie's race in new jersey both of them won when president obama had endorsed their opponent
at packard in poland and i'm sitting in a group like this with all our hp employees who were still looking at me like the company had looked at me back in the fall of 2011
because we didn't punish people for escalating we actually celebrated them
well i think he has not done a good job you know unemployment now nationwide is at just about 10% slightly
defend the will of the people of california regardless of what your point of view is on gay marriage my
was right for california because i had a better plan to solve the very significant illegal immigration problem that we have in california we have to secure the borders we have to hold employers accountable for only hiring documented workers we need a temporary guest worker program for our aggregate workers
one of my favorite people on this planet and it just was very fortuitous that i was presenting and happened to be on the side of the stage and couldn't get back to my seat in time when she was there so i was just grateful to be able to celebrate in that moment with her i'm incredibly happy for her
exactly yeah and we were shooting we would get ready we'd wake up before the sun came up we'd start shooting when the sun came up and then once the sun went down we were done shooting for the day so you're like back in the natural rhythm of nature which you just don't normally get to be in now in this day and age
on the front and it's all about the just iconic trailblazing women who did the same job that weaver did and all of the little eccentricities of it and how they put their life on the line it's really really fascinating
and so it was fun to just like imagine what that would be like and actually be kind of in the jungle in those situations
it was a really great day for me actually because generally my days consisted of running and jumping and climbing and that day i just got to sleep on a little pad so i loved it
oh i suppose i don't really think i knew what to expect i've never done a film of this size before so every day was sort of like magical and
and wondered if studio movies were a place that i could go to have a film like this is of this size and of a spectacle like this
producers would be there and we'd have some lego and lego would be there and we could play with that and sort of have bits of conversation but then talk with other people if there wasn't
like this occur your brain is just wanting to survive so it really can't look at the trauma specifically it has to shut it off until you're in a place that's safe and then the brain can sort of bring
shooting in order was kind of vital in that way that if we're doing a scene where you're going through the day and we're brushing our teeth and then we pick out we got to pick out our clothes on camera as to what we wanted to wear in the next scene
and so when the movie starts you're seeing a completely different person i mean you're seeing somebody who's been in a space with no sunlight very little nutrition no chance to be outside
i always saw it as like what's on the page like it's a mom giving up her son
you know run for your life and so that was kind of a huge part of my performance just fighting against those clothes
but he had these um these little star wars figurines and so when i was able to talk with him a little bit about that and that he was able to go okay so you know about that and you know we got to talk about
i think that those that love the book really enjoy watching the movie unfold but there's been quite a few people that i've spoken with that went in completely blind and it's like a completely
the ground so it was really awesome to be part of a film that kind of put this out for everybody to see
i think that how that sort of worked was that each of us had very specific characters that we came to the table with and making any movie is kind of like alchemy and you're putting all of these actors together and then you're watching
i think i'm still trying to figure that out i don't it's a very surreal experience that no one prepares you for and no one can prepare you for and your brain doesn't really know how to process it directly after the oscars i flew on a plane and was back in vietnam filming this movie so i was kind of just in the middle of nowhere contemplating my existence
i am such a huge fan of his work i think that he's absolutely brilliant it was a pleasure to work with him i want to do so many movies with him i think he's the best
him what an incredible actor he was and to keep going he just refused every time i would try and be like so jacob he'd be like nah i'm not saying goodbye to you i don't need to say goodbye i'm going to see you again i'm going to see you and he did that all day until the very end of the day where i finally was like i really need you to say goodbye to me and he tackled me to the ground
because it's really an it's a powerful moment to experience and i don't know how many people in the world have experienced this but when i got to like touch an elephant
willing to understand him and not use force i mean she's the only character that doesn't have a weapon
it asks some really great questions of us of what's important to us what are we willing to risk our life for how do we want to handle the untouched land on our planet how do we want to protect the vulnerable
for me what was so powerful about it was that here is this creature that could very easily
secluded parts to try and get the feel of what it's like to be in land that's been untouched by man so because of that like a lot of the time there's no cell service there's certainly not wifi it was too far away to go back to your trailer between setups
this push and pull where i get close to it and then i take a step back and i was sort of laughing and crying and
i didn't really think about it the precious stuff i don't think so much about when i'm making it
i don't know what i said at all i hope i thanked people
and then when he came up he's a very light whimsical person
start off in situations that are very simple and sort of dark in some ways but that's you need that darkness to propel them outwards into the world and into the complexity of life
stay away from looking at it but even just taking an hour in the morning
the whole thing i mean generally just the whole thing i'm not so i mean i think this movie beautifully depicts not only romance but just like sex and i read so many scripts that the entire plot point is about someone losing
by how moved so many people were and how deeply the story resonated with them
it's just they become hyper aware that you're there so within that when all of these egos are kind of getting inflamed and bouncing around she's trying to keep everything calm which is just kind of impossible
pretty much yeah i mean we shot pretty much in order so at first we were clean and then as time went on we slowly got dirtier and dirtier and then by the end of it it was part of getting ready for the day was
oh what's this crazy movie where there's this giant thing attacking these other tiny people you're just it's just like oh it's kong
it's part of our language i feel like it's like next to the question mark it's just a symbol it's a symbol that we know
when weaver is taking photos and she's a photojournalist it's all of those same shenanigans plus being a woman at that period of time when that was very difficult in a man's world and no light meter on her camera focusing a camera and running from things generally
other films you can kind of make character choices based upon the weather where you're like it's a hot day so i'm not gonna wear this jacket thanks wardrobe
think he thought for the longest time his only true love they met in college and she was a redheaded very quiet sweet girl and didn't go out very much was kind of a nerd and they started a band together called kid chameleon
aligned staff at a shortterm foster care facility so i'm kind of the person who deals with their daytoday so this is the movie deals a lot with the daytoday and this is part of the highs and lows
to eat a steak at the same time like scalloped potatoes doesn't work in the shower it doesn't taste good with water
i did a film with michael chapman when i was 15 he's an absolutely legendary dp
i just don't have any more to give and you realize that there's more and that life keeps going and that it is hard but that's okay and the movie continued to just reflect
scared me and i felt something that my mother had talked to me about so many times when she would get worried about me and i go why do you worry so much and she say because i love you so much you have no idea what this feels like and i kept getting these intense tastes of it
scared me it's the most wonderful incredible feeling in the world and it's also the most terrifying
and her husband has a son from a previous marriage named alistair
really cramped in there so our director lenny he would hide in the bathtub he would lay
the struggle for grace through much of the film is her not wanting to recognize things within herself and wanting to continue to throw herself into saving
all regulated it's not a jail it's not a prison so there isn't an actual locked gate and so if if any of the the youth are smart enough and a lot of them are
the thing that i've always had a hard time with is the formality of acting
thank you first to the academy i want to start big
i mean those are behind the scenes mysteries that i just simply cannot say
i'm wanting to put a lot into that interview scene that's at the end of the movie because i wanted to expose
pores i didn't wash my face for a long time to just get it all gross and at first you're sort of like oh god and then you adjust to it and then by the time she's got makeup on you're like why does anyone put makeup on
interesting to play or to be the above kind of puppet master to somebody
you know hiding behind a wall and it meant a week of just laying which was really really nice but then you'd have another week where you have to try and crawl over this huge warehouse and i got bruised pretty badly because there's lots of rocks and things on the ground
so anyway i said you have such a good sense of humor i'm so glad you're so ok with all of this and he was like yeah i was going to say the same thing about you
i think is what you're supposed to do when you are a bachelor but he did kind of give us some fun behind the scenes stuff of like talking about like what was happening when they were in the woods it was that episode where they were like doing the tarot card reading
kind of tough on the bingo card one of them is chris harrison appears it is like it's very that's a stressful one
so i guess the party's become sort of infamous at this point okay and a friend of a friend kind of found out about it and so he showed up at one of our gatherings a couple weeks ago
you're with me on that i thought it was gonna be danielle until the end and i really am upset that she let me down
i've never been part of a film that has had this kind of reception before so
i had become friends with claire of grimes and she was like i'm having a birthday party it's a costume party and i showed up as daisy from nintendo princess daisy
and been the only one in a costume this i felt fine with
just doing of the my very first scene with her and getting to like
i know how they shot that or i can see the reflection of the camera in that window or i wonder how many times how many takes it took them to do that or you just start to understand so much of the logistics of making a movie that sometimes the illusion is broken
i've spent probably a hundred times more time talking about it than we did making it or even talking before we made the movie
complicated but is also still a good person and is struggling with herself
one thing i tried for a while was eating dinner in the shower i was adamant that that was going to be a great time saver
and jake going off and trying to find himself which means for him kind of digging and finding weird bones in the backyard and for her
so they're thinking about identity and what it means to be together and what it means to maybe be separate and who they were before who they might want to be in the future and they kind of take a
but it's a great thing for so long we've loved women because they're beautiful and now we're seeing that you can be beautiful and there's a mind behind it and we're giving
although i didn't have kong there i still had these beautiful locations in this
not with queensland nickel i mean first of all let me just say that all these reports just say that we took money out of the company is just not true not one dollar ever went to me personally of queensland nickel's money
i've had $12 billion of investment in western australia employed 60000 people in the country what have they done really other than run fates and wrestles
there's been no courage about that but those families are just as important and the federal government needs to
no because everyone said that we couldn't win a house of reps seat in a six weeks campaign
and when i asked malcolm what he was doing at that time he said i'm making announcements mainly i've been here since i've been prime minister making announcements well we need a prime minister that actually does something politics is not just about making announcements and what i said today
as i said the truth is that i don't control the world nickel price but it's not about me who cares what happens to clive palmer hopefully my wife does and my kids do but who cares about politicians really it's what they can do for the country what they stand for how much time do we spend having a go at individuals rather than saying what are you going to do for the country that's the most important thing
than serving your own pocket so if people want to come to parliament they should come to do what good they can do and not leave with any entitlements at all
lazarus right he got about 6000 votes in queensland and 225000 votes from the party jackie lambie in tasmania got 800 and 22000 from the palmer united party so you know they don't have any political organisation they don't have any resources so it will be very hard for them but it's not a good
sydney and i'd spoken to ewan jones on the phone i said there was a $10 million gap in the cash flow and i said if the commonwealth covered that for three weeks everyone could keep employed and none of that would have happened and of course the member for herbert told me to get lost and the prime minister said he would see what he could do
i've donated all my salary anyway but i don't think we want people that will serve the community that's the most important
we will stop the 2014 budget and we will make sure that politicians
well i think that was at a time when we were just having the balance of power in australia
well i don't agree with it but neither does the federal court justice dowsett of the federal court two weeks ago gave an order restricting the liquidator of the refinery from making any decisions or making any decisions
gave a speech on gender equality which was adopted by the government in march so we'll now see on all commonwealth bodies a minimum of 40% of each gender so he's certainly a response
well that's not true she was preferenced 25th i think on our ticket she wasn't preferenced 1 2 3 or 4
and we won three senators as you know and i was successful in the house of representatives that sort of result hasn't happened since federation
no not really but certainly he's been responsive to some of our initiatives we've certainly suggested in parliament that we should have the chapter 11 and he's indicated the government will go ahead with that for insolvency
guarantee they won't be of course the 20 million dollar donation was back in 2013 and the company was completely solvent we had a bumpy year i owed the company 100 percent there was no debt there were no debt shareholders this is a free country
we also guarantee 10% reduction of electricity prices throughout australia the mining tax has been repealed
into trouble with the prime minister's chief of staff because i used her as an example of her income i didn't attack her personally i think it's wrong to say that my mistakes are i'm sure that the prime minister wouldn't say that about
didn't have the support of the community and we thought there wasn't an emphasis on how we make this economy go how we reestablish confidence and how we create more wealth
been achieved everyone whinges about the budget
to do something which will be good for the country he doesn't want to squander that chance or there won't be any more chances for him
well i think it's pretty clear what it covers there's a definition of an electricity producer and a natural gas producer it covers anyone that generates or deals with that commodity it doesn't cover anyone else
that time i had people as high as the vice presidency and of others that had no idea about the party's finances
for your prime minister is not that good really there's 100% of australians that need to be served and we need to see the right policies so far the government's been lying to the australian people
we don't have a problem in relation to our level of debt at all if we still kept going the way we were in 50 years time our debt would be less than the united states today
that's my name does that look like i'm trying to hide anything of course i'm not just let me say one thing if i can anna we didn't want anyone not to get their entitlements that wasn't our decision that was the decision of the administrators not us and i obtained $23 million on 10 march to keep the refinery going and the administrators refused to hand the joint venture
it's the responsibility under the joint venture agreement to monitor their expenditure
of course not that email if i wanted to make an appointment at the wild duck restaurant
which was instituted by queensland nickel when it was owned by the queensland government now queensland nickel when it acts in its own behalf which it rarely ever does doing its annual accounts and things like that have got no role in relation to the running of the joint venture
that worked for us i think all that was pretty good and the fact that we paid our staff 25% above award i think all that was good i think it was good when you look at the australian when it says i was the boss of the year on their front page back in 2000
of the business of which i am a member of the joint venture committee which tells the manager what he can and can't do on their behalf which is set out in a
when i was told by the director i think the accounts were signed by the auditor in september 2015
the government is 23 years of growth at one of the lowest debt levels in the oecd the treasurer tells everybody we've got a serious debt problem which is just a fantasy
along like me and offers us a million dollars that's the result you get whether it's in the interest of the public or not
to five members of parliament stater are being accessed are any crossbench members including me having their phones and their emails tapped or intercepted by any commonwealth or state agency or any foreign government doing this to give the government plausible denial are our parliamentary officers bargaining
they police it out and they say gee haven't we done a good job reelect us it doesn't matter who's in power liberal or labor this seems to be how politics works but it's not about
yeah sure we want to the most important thing here is not clive palmer the most important is keeping the industry going for queensland and australia
well that's not true that's just absolutely not true all those things you're talking about go back to 2013 and 2014 when the company made bumper profits and the nickel price was quite high
that as an investor putting all this aside i don't think i'm prepared to put millions of dollars in there unless this clears
well that was not in cash that was just in using offices and things like that
first of all cathy if it's ok i'd like to just issue a quick apology i'd just like to apologise to all those people that have gone to unitedaustraliaorg and tried to log on to join the party because they've blown up the website that's how we're going
well we don't publish our party membership numbers either do the labor party or the liberal party but we'll be applying to the aec next week and we've got a sufficient number of people to do that and that's the most important thing
and you'll find that we will in the coming weeks no doubt have members of parliament joining us and we'll be a registered party here in queensland so these people have no claim whatsoever to that name
now every other country in the world has a policy to let people get on the plane without a visa
the national party to have all these bogus parties or committees to confuse the media it's a very good tactic and they've probably taken it out of one of the books that i've written for them but actually we hold the business name for the united australia party you know something we also hold the business name for the name they're trying to register unifying australia
you can't have people that have never run a tuck shop run a 15 trillion dollar economy and all this policy discussion is a waste of time i've been there i know how it works no one listens to what they say on the press they're only worried about their perception i'm worried about reality
liberals are labor we shouldn't really say they're bad people we should want to get the best for the community i think we need to take away the gain from professional politicians who say the same thing it doesn't matter whether it's tony abbott or julia gillard they've got the same lobbyists in fletum the same focus groups we need to think about more what the people need
tony maybe you haven't realised that but i think i'm in fighting fit at the moment
i'm just a party member like everyone else and i've got to go along with the rules otherwise it would be wrong for me to presume i'd get endorsed anyway
the fifth one of course is we do think that australia needs to have a system where people who create wealth in various parts of the country that some of it goes back to that part of the country sort of that if a region is creating a certain amount of wealth they can be sure that that will flow back into their community so we really developed the whole country not just sydney and melbourne but right across australia because that's where the wealth comes from
he's been spying on rupert for years giving money back to chinese intelligence read the truth about it
lodge their tax returns yearly in arrears when they've actually made the money that will release $70 billion in the australian economy and each time it circulates the government will get $7 billion of tax on gst so if it goes around five or six times they'll get another $35 billion that means we'll have decent hospitals a rising standard of living and we'll be able to increase our pensions for our pensioners what's wrong with that
at three billion dollars a week what about australia and what the anzac's fought for we'll be up there and we've got candidates at 150 seats across this nation ready to take government if that's what the australian people want that we respect that rupert murdoch doesn't that president obama's immediate advisers advising rudd don't this is about australia
i'm not very confident at all carl we're looking for about 10 senate seats across australia that's what our polls are telling us you're just reading the rubbish that rupert murdoch puts out with the eoghan's news poll the eoghan's galaxy poll and he said he's going to support tony abbott as prime minister he's sworn an oath of allegiance to a foreign country he's not an australian citizen
who now have to lodge their tax returns quarterly in advance
talk about the people in the hunter valley that can't survive in new south wales
and we're taking immediate action in the supreme court to take it out that i'll be commencing proceedings against the lawyers that have said it that have breached their oath of honesty to the court
for me anyway i'm happy to make a contribution the best i can the whole point about democracy is about people having ideas and debate and things like that it's not about positions
minister for resources and the south african minister for resources and the brazilian minister for resources because again australia will be able to attract investment jobs and exports
well first of all don't worry about failing because we all fail at different times i've failed more than anyone else why we fail is maybe because the market wasn't right we didn't have enough money
we want a transparent system in australia because if you've got governments be they labor liberal or anyone else you don't want
of shooting sons of anarchy which i did right before i came to do this so i think i had maybe eight weeks or something like that to put on as much weight as i could
guys riding horses and sword fighting i said do they hire an actor that knows how to do those things my mom said i'm not really sure but i would imagine they hire someone else
one area you know he'd wanted to become you know one of the best boxers in the world and worldclass athlete and dedicated his entire life to that
to find a way to feel better or live in a healthier way and they
i love being in good shape not because of the aesthetic of it
reintegrating a normal pattern or rhythm of eating was very difficult after being so disciplined for four months about only existing on the bare minimum that i could i mean in terms of how you do it is really just starve oneself but it's also what became interesting
it never it felt good and it had the required effect and anytime i felt like it was a burden or a hardship i was quickly brought back to reality in that it paled in comparison to what fawcett himself went through
at what point it becomes an obsession is a great question i really don't know i certainly know that
it's a really interesting point it's the sort of the area that i was most interested in in making this film
challenges at one point or another in our lives that we have to try to overcome and i certainly could relate to that very very readily both in my career and in my personal life and there's a tendency to try to you know to maybe want to
to get to know each other really well and to just sort of stay in the vibe of the movie
my ritual i would wait till about 3 pm on christmas eve and then go and have a few bevy's with my best pal and then we'd go and try and do our christmas shopping from 4 pm
the day after we wrapped i just felt like i wanted to be in his place you know so
was the relationship with him my approach to working with him was sort of very gentle and nurturing and
film which was my sanctuary so that isolation and my love of film
i mean i always was i grew up in a very economically depressed place and i was really struck at a young age by the fact that everybody just was sort of in survival mode and people weren't really bringing forth the intention for their life you know and then i got moved when i was in my mid in my very early
desire to get out of the constraints that he felt of regular society and spend a bit more time in the natural world which was a consequence of him trying to find this
they were going to commit murder they were in an environment where something happened and something happened an environment and it was sat
your friends are telling you you got to do this bro there's no way out of this and all of a
there wasn't enough room for it to turn around so it decided it was going to go through
14 15 16 hours a day seven days a week was really an amazing gift
so we had you know we had some experiences but to me it was all just so exciting you know
and says well that's wonderful but i'm actually quite enjoying my life as it is so get somebody else to do that right of course it's not quite that simple
of the show had actually thought maybe i would actually have tattooed on me for real
longer breath but i also was on a tv show for seven years which is a different type of fame and it's almost a bit more frenzied or people feel more access that you're more accessible because you're in that living room every week
you know some magic on top and blow the scope way wider
i think that he put in a performance in this film that is going to really surprise people and i think it's going to be one of his career best performances to date i really do
carrier of it was the actual king you know that was really the only significance of it where we've
he's a lot sort of more rough and ready what we both were eager to avoid was
learning experience and period of growth working with guy
and he starts off and he's tough and he's streetwise and you know he's a little bit selfish but at the center of it he's got a good heart and you know he but he's doing great for himself he's got a lovely life worked out with his little crew in london
movie maybe three months after i finished doing sons so i'm sure there's flavors of him in there it certainly wasn't intentional though you know obviously you want every character that you play to be as original and unique and fresh as possible so you want to try to forget everything you've known but that was also my education on sons it was like going to an ivy league school
being on set and in the jungle but where i ran into a little trouble was in my hotel
to be in an environment like that but one there are certainly some challenges
i'm i late for work and i remembered the cat so i climbed up no cat up there
so i brought him down and put him under my armpit trying to
i did a lot of fighting did some muay thai boxing some jiujitsu guide the directors big into jiujitsu but mainly i set myself a goal of doing a thousand pushups a day minimum so
time set i'll show you and you ran up launched
didn't have to do any more shooting but like i said we were 45 minutes up a river so we were probably an hour and a half from the closest road so it was an unpleasant long journey
the spinning backflip and went face down onto the ground and
story about mankind coming together forget dropping our petty differences and creating some giant giant
you know because that's an area that's always interested me but the next acting job i'm doing is i'm going to i'm really excited i'm going to play king arthur with guy ritchie directing so we're sort of reinventing that myth and retelling that story
you say you can you know each room is connected and it just is kind of a fully realized rendering of this house
it's this absolutely fully realised incredible beautiful detailed interior of allendale hall the mansion
the process of it gave him that like now feeling of life like being really present in his life
business 12 to 14 hours a day so to stay to keep one's concentration for that long while starving
getting asked back to the party you know for somebody you know it's very hard to make a film you spend an enormous amount of time together and for somebody to express the desire to work with you again it's really flattering
weeks towards the end of arthur but it actually really wasn't bad so yeah i got sort of big i got probably bigger than i've ever been for arthur i got to about 190 pounds
such a smart actor that he always finds you know something internal something related
on set so although it was a bit disconcerting to begin with like
through two fingers but in terms of the impact yeah i'm definitely immensely proud to have been part of that
i'm still immensely proud of the impact that it had i don't know because it was my first
know and and so then and i had two films that came out back to back so i've been doing this now for six weeks straight five six sometimes seven days a week i've been in 20 countries in the last six weeks so i'm sure next week when i finally finish all of this and go back home it's gonna
when i think and talk about acting i'm much more comfortable talking about it in terms of being a craftsman that learns a trade and and tries to improve one's skill set through a career and apply a craft to it you know it makes me a bit nervous when you start to get highfalutin and talk about art and being an artist but at the same time
you know of being it felt reductive to me and i wanted to like move past that and let him
fear and faith and so yeah i could see that but you know i wasn't probably as aware at the time but in hindsight inevitably because i just finished
and no sound came out i said he is alive so i brought him down and put him under my armpit trying to warm him up
i went to one because it was the greatest two weeks of my life leading into the worst day of my life the most popular
we did it for so long and we all sort of fancied ourselves little you know outlaw
are embroiled in every day whether we recognize it or contextualize it in that specific vocabulary or not there's a version of that inherent in our daily struggle but you know at the center of it also it's
that one chooses to work with because as an actor you have very little input actually into the overall filmmaking process you have a certain level of autonomy
to try to show the physical manifestation of that and so when i first met guy he was very concerned about my physicality and he brought it up many many times actually through that conversation is where i believe i got the role because
separate rooms but you keep seeing each other going in and out of guys room and it's like a real sort of pressure cooker competition situation
i don't really believe in destiny per se as a predetermined thing
for this the biggest challenge for me was i think really just trying to understand what the correct tone of this film was gonna be it was we sort of set out to do something quite somber which is sort of right in my wheelhouse but then
process and so it's i believe that good
crown you know so it's almost like i think the offing was one of the first
kind of intimate personal human story and and so we would just talk
experienced a great tragedy and you know he basically
but you know it was great in a way i mean because i spent a lot of time in this comp art
trying on some trainers for my brother having a bit of a dance around drunk obviously
know a hundred or whatever and and he's very funny but sometimes it's at the expense of other people
he's a he's a but you remember you're a really funny thing i'm you know if i tell it it's not gonna be that funny but tim does really funny things on the set like he's never been on a set before where he'll like bump into the boom with his head
enrichment of their lives so i do think there's a kind of a conundrum about australia and it would be nice if it could
because it is really a marked difference in terms of your global engagement with the refugees you know there's 60 million refugees in the world right now so it's a huge huge issue but i also understand you are an island nation i understand that there are certain realities to that in terms of refugees coming by boat
has a way that you can apply and you can get a small business loan or you can get a piece of land
unfortunately i think it was always happening and i think we weren't aware unfortunately i'm not an expert in terms of the history of it but i do feel now that people are talking about it and i think that's key
people forced to flee their home because of violence and then they're on the road without protection they're subject to horrible horrible things that i won't even recount for you but the stories that you hear are just you don't know how people survive what they go through
on a global front in terms of their support women in conflict livelihood building in congo in uganda you're a major player and it's really wonderful to see
but it's so wonderful that the humane society has this night and allows us to speak about our causes because you know that's all one can do really is try to support the people who do the real work
and you can adopt an elephant for $50 a year or a black rhino which are
it's hard to tell in a concise way but basically i've loved elephants my whole life
and big red gum it's very very intense and you have to load the gum properly
i mean it set me up well for my other job because it's so technical and strange like i actually i did well i was so happy to have them but one of my big ones was big red gum
yeah out there with the hammer myself i built a greenhouse and then i've been doing a lot of traveling with oxfam i've been to a number of countries in africa and really enjoyed that work
the kind of business model of having to open a film everywhere but we were most worried about new york and the fans here obviously it's our hometown
know nothing will ever be like this again and that's what was so incredible about getting to come back together because nothing is like our show and our movie so we're very
you know it's a day by day thing that you kind of feel connected to everybody else
to dinner on friday night in my neighborhood in new york which is a really not hip neighborhood and i thought you know i put on my hat i went out to dinner everything would be fine
where everybody was like oh you know what it's all hype it's all hype i mean there were really people who said that we were not going to be that successful and i just think it's very much um you know the people who do these kind of prognostications not taking the female
biggest every market in the world they are shocked they do not believe me but
to kind of shed light on things and tell stories in a way that people can relate
around it and also the environment that it lives in would not be deci
i mean first of all we were never apart from each other that whole time everyone thought we were but we weren't so that helps and then number two we've been doing this for ten years like it's
good place for a lot of reasons first of all it's nice to be a little older i know that might be strange to say in our culture but like you know when you're younger and you're striving and you don't know if you're going to make it and then we have this you know tremendous experience with sex and the city
thing is that like it does live on like whether we get to make a third or not i hope we do but if we don't it still lives on it's so great to be a part of something like that that you feel so proud of
i would go as far as hopeful i just wish i knew and could tell you actually something like substantial
i you know it's i mean i'm not her but i am her saying
so they did a very smart thing they're going to start with like kind of their favorite episodes not from the beginning so next week on the 15th starts their favorite episodes and they sent us i think five that they had done the editing on
love them so much they've totally changed me like when sarah jessica first got pregnant that was the question everyone kept saying to all of us is she totally different and i was like no what do you mean is she totally different she's always been maternal she's always been caretaking
so sometimes strange things would happen like the background would go
the good storylines and the good dialogue i don't think anyone would care what we were wearing and that's why i think we've been able to last and i think our fans are just so loyal and so kind of outspoken in a wonderful way and they just go with us where he thinks so hard and deep about what we should do and where we should go i mean like
and all of us have kept in touch no matter where we are or what coast or what country we're all in touch and therefore i didn't have the total withdrawal though i did have the sadness of not getting to be shooting on the streets and having that whole energy of being together and having that dialogue and having the fans be with us and i definitely missed that part
we start out in manhattan and we catch up with where the ladies lives are and
and we took pictures on the way down for a magazine and then i had just you have a really
i feel very worried about these people i feel heartened by the oxfam workers who are there already i'm in touch with them they're probably really sick of me now but i would love to go back i feel like there will be progress soon and i would love to be able to report back to everyone who's
and how it was escalating of the people flooding into the dadaab camp we were so close that we felt well we need to get up there we just really were unprepared for how really shocking it is
yes can i tell you that it is absolutely gonna happen on a certain date no we're not that close okay but i'm certainly
but i mean shooting here in new york it's kind of intense and we wear four inch heels all the time 18 hours
i wonder if anyone's gonna ask my opinion and then once we started discussing it they were all like would i do this or would i say this or would i do this or is this on right and then i was like oh god now i feel like i'm like i have all the pressure on me like i'm like like i have to represent all of america
i mean we have some vocal coaches but when we first started i was just like what are they doing
and then the woman can't let him go and becomes kind of a stalker and basically ruins our lives
situations around the world and get to see things that i would never have gotten to see
luckily you can often check back we have people with unhcr who are
displaced people in the world is an unprecedented number
i literally feel the same way but i personally totally enjoyed it now i'm wearing pants i'm the only lucky person to actually wear pants that day which helped a little bit but you know for me i mean i ride horses i'm good i like that stuff the walking in the sand was way harder than the camera that is hard
i mean it's soft sand for there's no during i'm trying to say it's not like our beaches or our dunes where like there's actually hard ground under there sarah's entire shoes were submerged i was really i mean she
and i thought it was perfectly in line with everything that we've done in the past and
you know but that's good it's good to have embarrassment factors like remember when i tap danced in the show same feeling about karaoke and tap dancing very embarrassing extremely hard i was very nervous i'm not the singer i'm the least
in terms of what i've watched my friends go through and certainly i have my own i mean
michael had talked to me about what he wanted to do this time we see each other all the time that we're not working
i mean there's some people who speak out you know it's one of those things too where my group in particular i came to my group because i found this orphan
there's a lot of people where they don't necessarily invest their time so much as maybe just lend their name here and there and i don't know that that's so helpful at this point
well it's not that far away from kristen's own 80s incarnation so in a way it was a bummer like i love everybody else's and when i saw them on film i mean i laugh so hard at cynthia especially but you know i wanted some wild wig or whatever but i'm a preppy what can i say i mean you know it's kind of timeless i thought it was more fun to get to do the crazy hair
we were there the whole time together you know it was we often have had i mean we've been
for her that that she can't live up to it that she can't even really admit it to herself and much less to her friends so that's how we find her at the beginning
to and he started talking to me about whatever the last episode was like details and i
no no no they understand that we're someone who wants to help but they don't have tv they don't have electricity usually but sometimes you'll be in a strange place like maputo mozambique and someone will come running down the street oh sex and the city and you're always like wow
and ben said hey you should call that actress and they were like what actress and i had been begging them please let me help please let me raise money and they were like oh no it's fine we're ok we're ok and then because of the crisis as well like right now we have 36 baby orphaned elephants in the nursery
little tiny babies which at the time that i found chaimu in 2009 they'd never had that many like it's been increasing increasing increasing so we've needed more funding and more funding and you know once i finally begged them enough they'd let me get out there and raise some money for them which was really a good feeling
you know i can't speak for everyone though you know i can almost speak for everyone to say yes i mean i think that we know that we were incredibly lucky to be a part of something that was so big and so wonderful and so beautifully written and that people
you know what i mean you i was building a house and i i'm very lucky that i make a lot of money obviously and life is good and you think like well
think back to what he said not a promise of one new kilometer of road not one new kilometer of rail track want one new
said should go ahead i got two billion dollars from the commonwealth to do it
making the point quite a lot in time that the growth in disability far exceeds what we currently project are the costs
things that government has to do that we are currently not doing
that's going to need to be cut if we're really going to eradicate bracket creep
married people and single people who live in families
their position and in that position i would say is very doctrinal i don't see in the group of laity who have been invited people who have been willing up to now to actually
for women's greater involvement in the church when i was eight years old the bishop of toledo which is where i grew up toledo ohio the bishop of toledo
i was on a call back radio program and i actually rang in to ask him why girls could not be alter servers i don't remember precisely his answer but it was unsatisfactory to me i went on later in life to do a masters degree in systematic theology
the vatican bank or whether it's dealing with the issue of child sexual abuse in the church you'd have to think that through a wider variety of people with a wider variety of backgrounds and lived experience involved in the
artificial contraception now the vast majority of australian catholics the vast majority of catholics in the first world in particular
we're mindful that we have other things we have to think about
looking at right now is how we could use some of our policy tools if i can use that term
no of course not of course not and i've made this point time and again people who are engaged in corrupt activity tend to keep it very secret and that is the reality and that's why you need an institution like icac to expose these things and bring them out into public
that election but i now feel truly that it was two hands behind our back one put there by labour figures who undermined us in our own campaign and the other by a liberal party we're now seeing in icac the most extraordinary evidence people taking money in the back seat of bentleys
but the fury that i have for those labour figures and tripody has admitted at icac that he was aware of he claims it has been –
in the race in the yemen governments would actively undermine another labour
that level of energy and commitment as a politician isn't the same for me
i start with the person of jesus and jesus was human and divine
i hope i hope that the holy spirit is present and allows their lived experience to be present for the synod
well first of all can i thank as you know many
mentioned her passion for women's sport and i think we've got a great
you know this is quite confused in my view it says
the right to be adopted by the only parents they'd ever known and who loved them unconditionally
the opposition and yet they seem to have the same view about gay marriage they've come to the same point that it's marriage is between a man and a woman
of a fair go for all or what motivate me to get out of bed every day
and as a consequence we were able to deliver a period of significant reform
a new leader who can take up the next phase of our party's renewal unencumbered
there's my cabinet my mps and the candidates in every seat fighters each and every one in this campaign you did everything right particularly
i thank my local campaign team particularly steve belinda and phil
be some discussion with minister freidenberg and the energy ministers about investing
greg hunt has written an opinion piece in the australian financial review
deliver a plan for new south wales
the creativity and the compassion to imagine a better way than the status quo and the
but i'm proud mostly that we achieved this economic growth this job growth without cuts to services
now education is the great level of opportunity regardless of background and children in nsw public schools have some of the best literacy and numeracy results in the country and amongst the best in the world
my first task was to change government from the inside restore instability and restore stability
to respect that our first duty in government is never to ourselves but always to the people we represent and the values that we uphold
maybe there are reelected labor governments or the next government can do it but that would have been the easy way out we had that report it was pretty clear we needed to take action and so governments which should always act in the best interest of their own should act in the best interest of their own
and so that's what i've done it's very clear that the people of new south wales and the families of new south wales are facing high cost of living pressures it's the one thing people talk to me about more than anything else whether i'm in a shopping center or walking down the street or in a community meeting it's what i hear over and over again
if you'll forgive me for being parochial i will continue to fight for
would be of commercial benefit to them so that's what we sought to do
what we all want what i heard the prime minister say today is we all want better patient care the way that we get to that is through that cooperation and collaboration and i'm really confident about this weekend we still need to get all states to agree but on things like primary care there may be some differences
to families and that's the sort of practical assistance it comes on the back of my government's
your customers away from origin and true energy and that downward pressure as a result of that increased competition is already starting to occur in new south wales the owen report also talked about electricity generation and the need to have more base load power in new south wales and the
i put the state plan at the center of government setting clear targets and accountability for what we do
and the community will judge you on what you deliver each and every day
talk about something i haven't yet and that is a bit of expansion on something i mentioned in my speech
around the price of carbon is probably one of those factors and i think that's another reason we want to get that price
hospital system these are things i'm confident can be worked through at the end of the day
and what does he say now he says it's still a few weeks away
it might surprise you though to know that i am relishing it i am looking forward to this campaign i'm looking forward to it because it matters it matters to families who get to the end of the month and find they don't have as much money as they used to it matters to people who are worried about the future
now what i and so many others found distressing during the period of internal debate
in which we lived and we were responsible to help those who were in need
liberal premier barry o'farrell stand down from misleading the icac we've had two liberal mps resign from college
to stay in the newcastle cbd i came in and looked at this first started looking at it as a planning minister and yes i can see the challenges of having the heavy rail line that where it currently is some people say it's a barrier to urban renewal i say we're not ready to make that call yet rail though is incredibly important it's important if you commute from maitland
well certainly new south wales is a very varied state with the major metropolitan centres in newcastle and sydney and in the illawarra and then of course different challenges in the regions
together we all want to save lives and by supporting research into ovarian cancer we can do that
of people in the labour party who understand my ability to have some very direct conversations with them as i said i'm fighting this
sponsors have really got their heads around how to make use of an athlete who plays part of the year in australia part of the year
i expect a regeneration within our ranks the right mixture of new blooded experience i expect that that preselection processes will be as open and as transparent as possible as many rank and file preselections as possible
to delegate away authority to determine applications where political donations
well i'm hopeful i'm hopeful i believe passionately in these reforms they follow on from work that i did as planning minister
committee on electoral matters one of the recommendations of that committee which included labour and liberal members national members too was to repeal the ban on developer donations of course the cabinet looked at the recommendation from the committee but we made a decision not to proceed with it
i said this is the government's response however i'm aware that there are a wide range of views across the parliament across the country
it is entirely can i just say the cabinet received the recommendations of the joint
cruise passenger terminal somewhere west of the harbour bridge
on a program on the abc last night michael yabsley making an argument that
well it certainly drove his camera crew crazy because the shot was
and it's not exactly where you want to be and it's uncomfortable and it's scary and some days it's good and some days it's not
it's more a blessing than anything else i wouldn't be sitting here talking to you
not there anymore and then she started to drink and drug
it was a great i think opportunity for me to get to know one of my idols growing up
early part of my career i understand it i've made it work for me but i've always felt that i was a character actress in some way
a couple of shorts that he'd done i read the script and i thought why is no one campaigning to play this role this is so well written this is a touching film it's sweet it's a love story it's also incredibly tragic
no i always found them as the ultimate accessory for me i think they reflect your mood reflect your outfit on sex and the city working with pat field was such a pleasure she was our stylist and the last the cherry on the top always for any outfit
confusing in real life god knows the things that people have said to me and inferred especially after a couple of drinks but in reality
said to me he said well you know three hours is four play i said you've got to
and we put together a story of what that sex had been like
yes well you know i just really couldn't find something that was sort of original and new and
courageous and the thing that i loved about her the most was that she was not judgmental
such an extraordinary artist and such a lovely man is he's very present
for people my age who are not being addressed in the entertainment world so hopefully shows like sensitive skin there'll be more of them if this is successful and people enjoy it which i hope they will
the woman is going through a midlife crisis i'm still trying to break through barriers
and he said that he would like to come and see the play that i was doing which was anthony cleopatra at the liverpool playhouse
seen a scene like this before it becomes addictive especially for women's stories
well sometimes i feel that i disappoint people because i don't have the right thing to say or a funny line but i'm not
and taking a show that i love and believe in and sharing it with people and really getting the feedback we've shown a little bit at different
i could be this character of a certain age who was still incredibly vital
model role model that i had would probably be madeline kahn in the frankenstein movie that she did with gene wilder
not to the extent but there was paparazzi and there were a lot of people in marrakesh who know the show quite well and enjoy it they kept calling me samantha so i knew something was up
on and off camera we've grown up together this has been 14 years in our lives and when we met i'm 10 years older than the other girls so they were in their early thirties i was in my early forties but that seems like a lifetime ago so much has happened so much good has happened i think from the show i think that it's encouraged women to come together again
it really does get better and it starts with you taking the time and the energy and the commitment to find out what works for you
oh well here i'm absolutely terrified because it's my first big professional being on television talk show as with the joan rivers who i just idolized i used to watch her on the ed sullivan show so i see that i'm really scared my voice is slightly high like this and terrified because i never knew where she was going to come from and i was sort of waiting and i remember waiting
when a woman is going through menopause her partner is as well you have to join forces because
going through her first hot flash experience and it was incorporated into an episode of sex and the city
or physical it really is a change chord in your life and you really have to look at those factors that
because she's got so many choices she's so empowered but to play somebody who has i think some more heart and dimension than that series allowed samantha to have and really tell the truth about what a lot of women are facing which is not pretty it's kind of ugly it's hard getting older yeah we need to tell these stories though yeah we do we do these are american
if you come out and support it we might get legs give monica legs
who leads you slowly but deliberately into a trap and then
respect for him so i think that she feels that
like the characters in the film the same kind of climactic effect
it was so terrific because i got to kind of transform myself
similarly to sex and the city in the sense of making it about the city that you live in
that kind of chemistry was not lost the dialogue the wit just the way michael patrick king has interwoven these four women's lives and continues to do it so successfully i really have he's such a great talent i think he did a terrific job
and then i read that they were doing a television version and i thought oh i've got to talk to mammoth and see if i can get involved in some way
you have no idea how many men i've had to sleep with to get this award
not just the people who already know his music but sort of legends from the past and bringing people together in a way that i feel
and how it affects him in a very deep emotional way and i think that's why i still listen to his music and it still affects me not just because of the memory but also he writes about fame and loneliness and isolation
available men always do that because it's very safe to flirt but a single man wouldn't say that
well most of all of my professional life i've been objectified to some degree
personally i'm a big fan of it are you in the sense of yes i want to look my best you know i want to it's listen they photoshop babies never mind
so i feel that this kind of work is really important but first of all it should be entertaining it's not just about me looking in the mirror feeling sorry for myself
touching her face and around her eyes and her neck and i feel great empathy for the character and and even for myself being that raw and exposed
instead of part of the fabric of life if you're lucky enough to age and i you know to really
a girlfriend of mine sang to me and she'd already turned 50 and i said what is it like she said you know you wake up in the morning and you just really don't give a sh**
who i was a huge fan of and other shows like the office and he said to me john plowman was his name is his name and he said we would like to develop something for you and there's a series i think that you should take a look at just to see this writer and his work and it was this show half hour comedy which i love that format anyway
i got on stage with kevin hearn at the keyboard where the extra mic was and started doing it and lou turned around and looked at me i've never seen him so angry in my life
and i thought what is sensitive skin is it about beauty products i mean what is this
i uh after sex and the city ended i really it was kind of a bit of a tough time for me i mean first of all this great series that i love so much and um the end of some personal things and then my dad was diagnosed with dementia which was really sad so i i
it's kind of a dream because the more you play a character the better you know it and the better it gets infused with
with it constantly she's also still speaking from the mount of experience that she has
i think on sex and the city we've been so fortunate as actors to play these characters over such a long period of time
no i mean i think after about the fourth season i think we recognized that we had hit a nerve we were a zeitgeist so to speak but a zeitgeist is usually of the moment
it was jamie lee curtis and myself and sharon glass we were all under contract at universal studios and i remember i was here at toronto free and i was making about $250 a week and loving it
30 pages in seven years of your life and i had just turned 40 and i thought you know i don't really think i can pull this off i don't think i can be this sex maven at this time in my life maybe they should you know
well something incredible happened in the four years that we were no longer making the series which was quite extraordinary because when we left four years ago we were a half hour show on cable that was successful critically and we had a very strong
relationship affect their partner and i think it's made a lot of men more conscious i mean i remember one episode where one of the characters was broken up with on a postit
we were both up on our feet which is very unusual we have a wonderful director in mary eyre
fabulous ideas and how to apply how to start a wardrobe a professional wardrobe for a woman that little black dress all those wonderful things that i sort of learned along the way
issue that had not been addressed and you know there had not been a regional discussion if we if we look at labor peace i mean you know we've been talking about
and influence policies that will make the world safer for people that is one of the things that is core to my reason for being in politics
my take is that it's unfortunate that there was a rejection of the national aboriginal organization's call before that call had even
the most important issue and the one that we kept coming back to was creation of jobs and the economy and there were a couple of issues that we discussed under that rubric and the
provisions were adequate and that they were in place and it broadened to a discussion about marine salvage you know it's again we're sitting around the table with people from all parts of the country and so making sure that that the movement of goods the movement of dangerous materials and the the reaction
of the governance of metrolinx i think that what we need to make sure is that when a plan is put in place that that plan gets implemented
a woman premier in alberta i'm there as a woman
well i'm not going to presume to give advice to the us i think i can give advice to ourselves just to go back to your first comment about the wild rose if you follow the social media that happened after that incident in alberta there was a homophobic
for just a change in that talent not a devaluing of some and a valuing over of others but just making sure that we've got everybody being able to bring their voice to the table
we have to recognize that you have to look at the numbers you have to look at the experience you have to look at the regions and i will do my best to have representation from around the province experience
talking to me about not being able to get to the table where the decisions were being made on their campuses about sexual violence sexual harassment policies not being part of the conversation and i just i had to be held into my seat because i'm 63 we were having that conversation 45 years ago enough
our concern with the afrocentric school was that we really believe that kids from all races and backgrounds should be together i really believe that in ontario which is one of the most diverse schools in the world
we still believe that there's room to grow that's why we set the 75% target and it's a work in progress i'm going to be meeting in the next few weeks with folks from around the world who are looking at their own living
spring or in the winter time they go to performances they go watch kids play play different sports they take part in activities at the school
begin those conversations because they're difficult and you know if a if a fouryearold or a fiveyearold comes to school and that child lives in a lesbian or
off in 20 years spread it over a 30 year period as you would a mortgage
in one at a time the tolling decision was about affordability for people it absolutely was there had not been a regional discussion
have been about trying to help people to deal with costs you know the investments that we've made in electricity the fact that we have a reliable clean
they for whatever reason are not on the same page as maybe the others of us you know that there are divisions that we haven't acknowledged and so i think if anything
to change the working world and create jobs as well i think that we need to celebrate that in ontario we need to celebrate 50 years of that relationship between the working world and the labour market and these terrific institutions that have evolved over the last 50 years
and that versatility it was terrific so there's a lot going on at humber
decision that we would reorient the system and put that money into grants for low income so really it was working with
learn from that but i'm not giving up on the values that i've been fighting for since i was 15 years old you know when i was growing up in the
everybody in the community is involved in something i've been to the farmers market i was here for the walk a mile in hershey
so we celebrate the two at the same time my heritage my irish heritage it's very important to me that we recognize
so i will follow their lead but just to actually merge your last question
that that's a great shame i would like to see for example i'd like to see people understand better what world religions are and how do we separate religion
for example and we've done various things across government to recognize diversity but it seems to me that recently because of some issues like carding for example
celebrations it's just a wonderful celebration of spring and we always joke because it comes very close to st patrick's day
well you know what we can have that semantic discussion
again those students will not receive less support than they receive now so the middle income
but just to go back to the beginning it would have been irresponsible if we had not made the investments in the electricity system that we've made
run right exactly and our target then is to continue to manage the
is that not everybody in the province who is actually eligible has applied and so i've talked to the head of the ontario energy board and i've said you know what we've got to do better about reaching people
stopped and we have not you know because i really believe there has to be a balance we have not taken all of those tools away from police officers they do
zoning of the municipality and so what they can do then is bump the refusal
let's put the decision making at the local level and make counselors and
and it's exactly why you know distribution companies need to make sure that people who are living on low income and who are that strapped get that access it is the ontario energy support program is a program that people need to apply to
part of the province and recognized that they didn't have the kids here didn't have access to postsecondary education in a way that other
we're doing that in order to build new assets for your children so this is an asset that the people of ontario have owned for a very long time
i you know for some time now we have been working to take costs out of the system so we renegotiated agreements like the samsung agreement which is actually taking billions of dollars out of the system we made a decision not to build new nuclear michael because that was
i mean this was a decision at the local level i'm not going to pretend michael that i wasn't disappointed because i was i was disappointed i would have liked to see this plan go forward
in terms of it's a huge number michael and you and i it's really hard to it's hard to imagine those numbers yes but we made a
set up with the doctors that were agreed upon both by the government and the doctors doctors occupy a sort of unique place in
here's my greatest concern and i can speak as the mpp for that particular community but also as the premier my biggest concern about the way that issue was dealt with is that there were rifts that were created in the community
the proposals that were on the table and he recommended to both sides that the doctors should that this is the agreement or the
universities are required to top up that tuition payment so you know it is a real change in the way we're doing tuition and supporting students in the province
yes exactly they can expect the 30% off tuition and then there may be other adjustments because of their circumstances
will be much better off and the other thing is that each student when they make their application there are other considerations so it depends you know what the number of students in a family the family is supporting whether the student is going away from home to go to school all of those considerations are part of the calculator
in place and so that kind of collaboration talking to the provinces upfront
actually we didn't know exactly what was happening and in fact when he started to move people in the box were saying he's moving okay charles is moving and i would look over and he was standing perfectly still so i had no idea what was going on
that people have to make a decision about whether they're ready to accept that or not
stepbystep development that led me in this direction i didn't i didn't i wasn't independentminded enough as a young person to go my own way and music was a path of least resistance
have been i think the best invention in opera since supertitles
clients with them and working out of their living rooms probably so that's that's really new
excited this is the first time i've seen the set it's beautiful and it's been
it's just really interesting and unique ideas i mean robert and i have worked together a lot and and it's as usual it's such a pleasure
i play her through the lens of my own experience but i'm her
it's interesting because i sang several productions when i started out and then i thought why am i singing this i can do this later so i put it away and came back to it about 10 years later and did another sort of run and then this
orchestration but also the transparency and the life and andres oh my gosh he's just brought so much joy to the whole thing the way it sounds the way it sparkles
having a blast it's a big party act one is fun act one is delightful and octavia of course she's in love she's in that sort of bloom of the experience
it's a much more lively and in a funny way it's a younger marshall in than i've been playing for a long time maybe ever
and not just tempo and not just everything else and also even with we singers when i started at the very beginning there was still
you know to have one roll under your belt twice before you're 17 is pretty neat so i don't see anything right at the moment but i think what i'll do is start concertizing more with music theater repertoire people love it i just did a rodgers and hammerstein group in in gestalt
in the prologue that's about to begin the former pirate simon bocanegra is urged to overthrow the aristocracy
you know it's funny the whole role the act ii the mute act is the hard part i mean that's really the part where i just think oh my god how am i going to hold people's attention
well that's an interesting point you know when i first sang it it was in english it wasn't known gabriela benatcheva the wonderful wonderful soprano brought it to the met first and she was my model for how to be in this part and i just we
yes and my parents also sang and they practiced and there were memorable nights when the whole neighborhood would come around the front door on a summer night and listen so it was a really heady environment in terms of
and i also really believe that people didn't sing the same way that they do now we now are filling huge halls singing in a much more athletic
i think he was a very natural singer but you know people say that about everyone
skow gave at carnegie hall again when i was a student of all of this sort of unknown repertoire of the major composers
so hard and partly because the repertoire that i sang was uncomfortable
viable way while the audience will still want this immediacy of kind of instant music
with simplicity that's coming from your heart that can very often trump
reputation is that you're impossible to get but once you have committed to something you are there i said that's not so bad
suspect that there's a surprisingly large percentage of operas which are cast around the world now off of youtube
in a major voice in a sort of worldclass instrument particularly in verdi puccini and wagner absolutely
the tendency interestingly enough physically when you're singing and when you're learning
so but if you don't have that sense of getting to the heart of what it is you're saying
it is a bonanza as you said for just discovery and you can sit there for hours just following the trail of some obscure wonderful performance
so much courage and and and she's quite and she's clever
really challenging i mean in fact when i first read for the play it was sort of you know for the experience i thought oh i'll do this reading you know but if i said them but of course you realize i can't i can't do it i can't do the play because you know we're i'm too booked up
on the other hand one has to i think consider the time and the kind of the difference between the two of them
recording in a tiny little dry booth was a bit of a shock so vocally it's natural i'm singing where i speak
exactly well in some ways it's stressful of course because i feel a tremendous responsibility to those people that in the case of 911 that i'm trying to give comfort to in the case of the inauguration
permission to be who they are and to find their own unique path
and i've since gone over another time and spent three glorious hours with her and after about five minutes i realized that what she was saying was so important and i didn't want to forget anything so i said ms price could i please take notes and seven pages later i would come home and transcribe these notes because i just thought i don't ever want to forget what she said
when i got to meet him actually after the audition and the happy news was that they said you know we really don't have a place
completely shattered with the smallminded behavior of the three men and of course this is based susanna and the elders is a story in which many many great paintings in history are based so it's a theme that we've seen before
and we performed recently a new song cycle which was written for me this past season by henri dutier
her voice in such pristine shape over a long period of time what a great woman great life
one of the other things i really admire about james levine is his commitment to new music and to music which is not always embraced by the public at large but which inspires him
get anywhere and of course i don't really know why but the rest is history and i did eventually find my way
it depends on the genre in a recital program with piano it's an equal partnership i want the audience to be distracted constantly from what i'm doing because the piano playing is on such a high level and so music
19th century and the 18th century so i from that i believe that the technique of singing was far different than it is today
yeah because it's sort of leaked it's on the internet but actor austrian actor christoph wald
because there were throngs surrounding the car so exciting
peruvian composer trained in helsinki which is one of the great composition schools great orchestrator a real
besides josh we have alison krauss me and eric owens are classical sutton foster and norm lewis are broadway i don't even know if any of these names
well i mean the scheduling thing for me has always been the biggest challenge also because i have two children so trying to figure out how to
as much as i'm known for it and as much as i've done it i've only sung revivals
it's easy to explain you know i can describe in five minutes how to sing but doing it
hip length white charmeuse negligee running around beautiful beautiful soprano and running running running running and then she had to sing the song of the moon
one to the other i mean there's a reason that thomas jefferson and einstein played the violin and they played the violin so they could kind of
to low in terms of range and dynamic range it's also absolutely every extreme
it's exhausting emotionally as well it's not just the drama of the singing although if you really want to invest the right amount of emotion in this part it is
in some ways more reliable but the four or five year i'm really in my prime right now
yeah incredible and an incredible person and certainly james levine who's here leading my home
but i don't speak the language so i'm kind of singing by rote the sounds and i know what they mean of course but it was
i'm glad i put it away several early
i'm really grappling with this issue what in life is important
what should my priorities be right now am i giving my children enough time
subsequently or then followed by a deep sneeze because i get really bad hay fever
if you've done something during the day and you then have to compartmentalize it to going to the next part of the day to start afresh
and it kind of opens up a story of good versus evil a much more epic story
rowling's imagination like getting to kind of delve back into that world the world that she created with the harry potter film
but it's set in the 1920s so it's all about world but in this kind of different era different period so it's great
something that as she's beginning to transition it's finding comfort in herself and finding herself and when i felt like i'd begun to discover her smile that was a wonderful breakthrough
thank you mate for me finding lily in this film was about finding her smile and that being
i mean i saw it in imax one of the first times and you can literally sort of trace it's like dot to dot on my freckles it becomes like a kind of
taught me so it was a bit of an education it's one of the great things about my job is you get educated in weird and wonderful parts of
of technology and lights and things with art and the known and the unknown it's how those two things collide and you never know whether they're going to work i suppose in some ways it's like steve and pinchey
do you know what i was pretty ignorant and the whole experience has been and it's been three or four years that i've been attached to the film and learning but some of the most simple things were perhaps the most i couldn't believe that i didn't know like the idea that
wha ahh thanks thank you for making me sweat
i suppose the moment that i feel and it's nothing compared to
quick answer no no and it's that hilarious thing by which when before you're a parent you sort of hear people talking about
yeah so we which was so we had this fan event for fantastic beasts and we were all there and then
o'clock in the morning and you go in and you're sort of gently furious and then you get a little smile and your heart breaks a bit and it's totally worth it
she was so calm i was holding for a bit while she was being really calm and she cried and i
extraordinary imaginations and when i read this script it was sort of it was it was like going into another entire world and the process of making it was wondrous and fun and freeing and so i hope it will certainly be on it will be unlike anything i've ever done and i hope it'll be a crazy
all the photos i could find of stephen when he was younger and tried to work out with the specialist what his unique decline would have been and then i worked with a dancer to help try and find that in my body and i suppose the last aspect was then meeting stephen and jane and jonathan and the children and really getting a sense of their personality
no but we were at the same school together as well we basically yeah we got a long way
no i mean i sang when i was a kid i'd done maybe i think i did a production of cabaret when i was at school but i'd never done anything on screen like it or anything professionally really so
i'd taken that for granted quite how enduring it is but it was wonderful
getting to watch channing and mila work they're like channing well he had to learn to rollerblade for this film he's a proper movie star through and through and the physical work he had to do i think sometimes
and i did i loved the lion king when i was younger and i had a weird obsession with nala
but i do love the idea some other people have also gone you know will you method on this have you become brighter since doing it
a sort of extension of your body because you are unable to move certain things and so there's a very intimate dance that happens and so felicity who's an old friend she and i had worked for several weeks at all the different stages of the film trying to make sure that there was this kind of symbiosis between the two of us but no no people
of cramp without you getting spasms because when you're filming you have to sustain those positions for
i will never forget i was sort of whining about something one day and i think michelle was like
or i would type swear words into his voice machine and press play on repeat and that was so important because until then i was wanting to be absolutely respectful but forgetting that there was this one gentleman i met who had als who the morning i met him the night before he had gone to er having almost genuinely
and she was wonderful and her book was a bit of a you know i had to be careful because i was also very protective of steven's point of view so i was reading all of his material and he had written an autobiography that came out around the same time as we started filming but certainly her book in its intricacy and its detail was really important as far as playing a superhero
it was about i always saw the painting somehow as a routine it was as if she needed to sort of shed some of that restriction to find who she was
i arrived to meet him and there was this very unique rhythm this kind of long long pauses
and we were just incredibly inappropriate and we were so sort of wanted to meet her that we just sort of literally stalked about four meters behind her for an entire evening and eventually i think she was like ok what what what
was the very first scene that we shot and that was him sort of young and healthy but then that afternoon
some kids came to visit the set when we were filming and because they build so much of it and so many of the
or let me take a bit of time off and it's been amazing i love time off
this was shop and i'd just go and look through the window it was where you bought proper magic kit you'd buy the wherewithal to sort someone in half and anyway so when i used to go and stay with my grandmother i'd be like she lives in edinburgh and we'd go can we go and find magic shops when i got cast in this no one was more excited than my grandmother who was like i don't want to
and she is incredibly passionate about it and i can't think of two more passionate people to take those stories and take them out into
catherine's character with tina it's a sort of slow build connection these two people who are outsiders and yet passionate people sort of begin
you gently start sweating i think also because we are all fans of the films the potter films you're like your own harshest critic it was so wonderful to delve back into jk rowling's world at this different time but you want it to be wonderful
i found ian holm who'd played it in lord of the rings and i tried to copy his character and
suits and it for me it read as almost like a an exoskeleton like kind of scaffolding propping up this sort of masculine
everything you can and so that's kind of how i went about it but it was important for me to meet people from different generations because when
lily story and gerda's story which is an incredibly powerful love story questioning the fact that love is about the soul it's not about sexuality it's not about gender
being trans and what that is like and it continues to bring up the conversations that need to happen about discrimination about abuse about health care all of those and i hope it continues that dialogue which is so sort of rife at the moment because they're still along
and she helped me sort of train a bit like an athlete train your muscles to be able to sort of stay in these positions for extended periods and at moments it was complicated but also every day you were aware that you could get up at the end of the day and many of the people that i met who lived with als
science fiction and original and something kind of weird shakespearean and greek and i have no idea how they've managed to meld all those worlds what they have
one is having a mentor one is having a coach surrounding yourself with those people
staying active in any way shape or form is always going to be better for you
continually try to reach perfection rather than embracing differences and especially with young children i found that so important in high school when i attended high school i saw that more and more that there are teenage boys and girls that simply do not understand differences
to hide away ignore and not address and when we have boys and girls teenage boys and girls dying every day because of eating disorders that are 100
where that would be possible after i won miss america my grandma
where my grandpa grew up and he was explaining to us that when the communist soldiers came through drafting young men on the island into the army there was a large fireplace
and a national staff so donald trump has no hand in it he's actually tried to buy the organization a couple of years but we continually tell him not for profits or not for sale and he has no hand in it
she was not able to find out where he went and she had no idea where he was
and that time was so critical for me you know i loved school
it was something i never thought i would enjoy that's for sure i was very shy as a child and as i said my mother homeschooled the six of us
and that's pretty much all you can handle as a preschooler and then when you graduated you would graduate to
it was so scary to jump into a public school for the first time in my life but i knew it was something that i could do
that would signal that it was their turn to come to america a place that they did not have to be afraid of the dictator
was constantly on her mind and in her heart but through the age of
that timing happened i thought i was skipping a year of high school so i could graduate law school early and not be in school until i was 24 obviously that's now going to happen but there was something else in the plan that i didn't see that i didn't know about
those assignments and we had to find out these certain bits of information from our relatives so we went all over the island interviewing lost relatives and people we didn't know people we did know
those things i didn't find that i didn't dedicate myself to any one thing i had my friends that were planning on going on to be concert pianists or professional dancers but i knew i was
purpose and so you know like i said it's been incredible to realize that there is a purpose and a reason and a meaning to everything that i've done
because of the country that we have and because of the freedoms we have and that has taught me so much about making the most of it
i found it was a place that i could excel for years i had been searching for that
i am clay in your hands your humble servant willing to do whatever you wish for me in your per
especially at this time that my generation is in i feel like many people are searching for role models for examples for hope for inspiration
thing i was hoping to address is one of the main reasons i am also doing this
area going to school so i certainly hope to be even more involved in the race there as well
really feel comfortable in being by myself and alone with god and not always meeting people around me and sometimes that's difficult to survive without that support group without your inner circle but it's something that really made
back home and driving through scottsbluff and gearing again it feels like nothing ever changed and so it's hard to remember
just falling apart and very strongly contemplating jumping off the top
any reality show any competition whatever it may be many of them use it in the same way and i don't think that that is any
well you know honestly in my perspective for me personally
i think that any industry any area of life any job can potentially objectify women it depends on if you allow it to
only see positives and i didn't see how it was going to hinder me because as ms nebraska i traveled by myself and i wasn't old enough to stay in hotel rooms by myself so i had to stay with
you see that you can't go into an airport and yell bomb you can't go into a movie theater and yell fire that's free speech yes but sometimes it comes to a point of security and that's where that line is drawn and so we have to be very careful with that but we must draw the line somewhere
guitar other things and once you start playing piano other forms of music come a lot easier
they have a new one every year we actually every former miss america gets to keep her crown so i still have mine and i think it's
but to understand that that is where the only rights in federal government lie it's not that the constitution leaves us powerless it leaves the federal government a lot less powerless than the people and i think that's something that no matter what issue it may be we need to find does the constitution have anything to say about it
with them so when i got to the high school i realized that my friends were from very different walks of life very different cliques
and now looking back of course i realize how had i not done that i would not be
you know and going into the school was just interesting to me to find they were all in these groups that didn't interact with each other and so people would ask well why are you friends with that person are you friends with that one and i said you know we have these common interests in these bonding similar passions and it doesn't matter that we're in different groups
it's cool to have bragging rights to their friends but other than that it's it's nothing to them they actually begged not to come to the miss america pageant because they would rather stay home and play video
any positions that we're taking when it comes to federal issues need to have constitutional backing and we need to see how that relates otherwise it needs to go down to the
risk factors can also be monitored with third trimester ultrasounds to ensure that baby is properly growing and that the placenta and umbilical cord are providing baby with the oxygen and nutrition he or she needs
eating right taking care of my body and regular visits with my obstetrician there are things i can do every day to monitor my baby
it all kind of fits together but that was a super fun episode and we had an awesome time working with her and promoting something so worthwhile
but for this one it was actually this one was started i guess by an episode of victorious where rex is actually a talk show host named
so i hate watching myself but the blooper episode the last one that we did was the one that i will watch repeatedly because it was just us goofing off and being ourselves
where i actually filmed one of them and i guess it's on theslapcom where i play myself but they carried it over and for this new one called electric bloopaloo
so they have the shells laying around they have the spaghetti and the meatballs and i'll be darned if i didn't make myself a few of those
a long time ago that he was doing this and again i had no idea what it was about but when i was looking at the email for this there was another email that i got years ago that said that he had booked this movie
schnoodle named oscar and i love him he's very much a puppy we got him in december and he's still kind of mischievous but we're dealing with it he's adorable
point where you just always have the same one like go to the gym more stop eating crap all the time you know so those have just kind of become my like new year's refreshers i guess
so yeah but as far as just tornadoes i have had a warning siren go off but it wasn't close enough that we actually had to do anything about it i think the closest disaster i had was a wildfire
it's been great from what i've been able to see i only got to see one goal so far which i was disappointed by but i'm glad i got it right at that moment but yeah i've been up in the 300 level
you guys have been so receptive and welcoming and kind and gracious and all the staff here at the manitoba moose team they've been awesome i've had a really really great time and i feel very welcome
yeah well actually we shot two days so i had to put it on in the morning and then take it off that day and then i had to put it on the next morning isn't that a lie
my dad wants ucla so yeah i'm a diet you're not a
yeah so that one's called i saved your life and that was a really really cool episode to shoot i got to wear like casts and stuff because i was supposed to be hit by a moving vehicle so yeah so i got to wear a cast tell us about this
guilt of that when he realizes that he is the reason why his brother is missing because he encouraged him to go off with caitlyn they went off and did their thing and now they're in all this trouble i think trey has a little bit of guilt in that and he wants to rectify it by going out with his dad and rescuing him
i didn't know that the storm was gonna come it was my fault so he he's the one who brings these guys together and then i think the
be extremely cool because the maze runner looks absolutely amazing
yeah i mean i get teased about pretty much everything that i do in one way or another
so i ruined a whole take because you know every time you did that 150 extras had to walk through the door before me so they had to reset all of that because i went in at the wrong time it was like i just felt like in the grand scheme of things they weren't really that big of a deal but because i didn't know it was my first time really doing this i was
everything is just completely different and it's it's great jumping between the two not not only you know comedy and drama but film
i really don't even know if i belong in a house i think i'm just a straight up muggle but if i was to pick one i would probably want to be
gratifying you know when people like what you do and you know you're walking down the street
i will walk out of the room i can't handle a tv that's on like level 12 because it's unacceptable you have to beat either 10 or 15 there's no middle ground 20 if you're feeling really brave but besides that everything has to be in fives i feel like there's no point in them even
it look great and yeah you would never know it but one of the cool things like the story of bruce the shark on jaws
dance together and then gibby basically cancels at the end and sam's really kind of upset about it so people are thinking wow maybe sam actually kind of has it in for gibby and the fact that he turned her down was kind of disappointing to her and all his stuff so i could
we were definitely pretty shocked it's always a little bit of a challenge to know that somebody is going to be
actually one time it actually worked out pretty cool i was able to be an extra in the episode
so that was 2004 and then late 2006 i got the audition for icarly
you know basically it breaks down to us doing an episode a week and we rehearse monday tuesday wednesday and then shoot thursday friday and so through the course of the day we have to get on average three hours of school in
going into it i had never worked on one project basically for more than a week
he's so confident with himself and he's always quite the party boy neville's just kind of evil so gibby is definitely cool
right exactly i mean i definitely prefer icarly over a little bit part on drake and josh because this is so much more
the movie came out i was always talking into a microphone onto a blank screen so i never saw my character until the movie came out and then see and
absolutely nuts and i thought this was the pinnacle of it and i was blown away everybody was like oh yeah no no by saturday
and i think that obviously people are just going to assume that it's a phenomenal looking special effects computer generated movie but i think you can see that pretty clearly from the trailers but i think what people are going to be really surprised by is the story of the human element and i hope that's what people enjoy out there
that's true there's some people you know who play everything on expert it's like literally you just see a blur of fingers and everything i will never get to that phase of my guitar playing but
i'd say maybe like 200 or 210 something like that but i've never tried my trainer is very much against bench press in general just because he says it puts way too much strain on the joints and there's a lot more exercises that you could use that are more productive
in the news lightning became a thing there was a lightning storm in venice beach and a boy was in the water lightning hit the water right next to him and he died
my hats usually because i don't have a haircut that i've chosen myself or hair style
i mean the list is endless for me i mean at the moment and people who were kind of i think very
it's been amazing similar to these guys it's truly a dream come true all i can say is i'm very thankful for the opportunity to play or have the experience of something like that it's been truly a whirlwind and i'm very excited yet very nervous about it coming out it's a dream an absolute dream
the fact that he basically used to poison so many people but then he had to antidote and the antidote didn't
i wish there was something like this that was accessible to me as a child if you know what i mean because i think it would have helped me understand
i think in a positive way it's bizarre to say thanks for crying
there was a lot of things that i needed to research actually going into it and one was how to
and then also the fact that we had an amazing director but
you can tell when someone plays an instrument you can tell just from what they do with their fingers or how they pass the time
physical life of a character before i find the sort of emotional or mental
it turns up to set every day with loads of ideas of how we could do this and how we could do that and yeah it was a true pleasure to work with her i hope i get the chance to do it again
being familiar with the source material and you know being restricted in that sense but speaking to people along the way i'd realised quickly that everyone who goes through something like this you know has
sort of laugh with jokes we had that i had no idea about especially being english i was like i don't know what you're talking about but i'm not going to laugh with you i'm going to try but no like i said they were very…
i did i actually played snake quite a lot i have to say honestly it took me back to science class at school i just sit at the back
i don't know and there's also the obviously the obvious which is a live audience and you feed from the audience and you find new things during during
welcomed i guess change and wanted to make it the best film possible so often would ask my opinion on directing moments you know when i spent so much time behind the camera he said you know what's an easier way we can make this work
being in a horror movie and watching a horror movie three very very different steps along the way of something that's very very very tricky
and you know in a sense what i think attracted me to this was that it had a lot of similarities in the sense that it was told from pov at times and it was about something that you didn't see all the time or barely at all and
you know what i mean it's one of those faces that every time you see someone being scared it's quite a kind of funny right so running through like the woods for example turning around and seeing someone else going
the previous three films have been building up to so you need to give the fans what they want you know
a lot more to fight for and they want the future to be the best it can be and therefore yeah
it was very close to home for me and it was the first time i'd ever done anything contemporary
for the snow white and the one that i was in so it was we should have met so many times along the years but for some reason fate brought us together at this very fine moment
one hell of a pressure to kind of make people
where do i start no i think i think the moment me and lily met there was an immediate bond and immediate chemistry like a connection we have a lot of mutual friends and connections within the industry and we realized that we both auditioned for each other's snow white
so i spent a lot of my time doing musicals and i think she knew that i was a bit of a drama queen even when i played football i probably spent most of the game crying
that i was their finnick or worthy of finnick and everyone had a very very different preconceived idea as to who should play that part but everyone had a very
we decided we're going to go for a take so i was like yeah fantastic
through one accident loses everything and i think that to me is an interesting
it's mayhem but you know such a privilege to be here
it's an epic story it's also the next installment of an already well established film and i genuinely believe that it's going to get people talking
really enjoy francis's vision i mean it's kind of keeping
that moment and then when we kind of eventually got there i think we were so nervous and like
game the amount of time i think there was something really wrong with me and jennifer that we were
or it's fine but yeah i did that and that was very exciting
i've tried my hand at writing a script and i found it
were incredibly great scenes i then realised i didn't know what was going to happen after that or what happened before that or i think structurally to have the gift of being able to structure something
i kind of tried to use that to channel into how will would be feeling but it's impossible to really understand the full struggle and challenges that someone in a wheelchair lives with every day but i just try to do my best
an inspiration it inspires a nation to come together and sort of
enjoying it and experiencing it through our eyes with us
to base camp or where the set was and he was just chatting and i was like this is i feel really comfortable in here i'm welcomed you know it's such a beautiful place and you have the best of everything here i think the best guinness the best views it's a really wonderful place
room together and kind of put us nose to nose and told us to like talk to each other it was very intense but then after that we
know creating an alliance well he's very keen to obviously from the beginning but yeah i mean i think he's a very sensitive soul and i think a lot of people can take away from him
so having the opportunity to work with her at last is
