the last few days to assess whether or not boris could lead that team and build that unity and i came as i say reluctantly but firmly to
leading the conservative party and the country at the moment someone with experience at the highest reaches of government we need someone who believes in the british people's verdict that they delivered
that as someone who had argued from the beginning that we should leave the european union and as someone who wanted to ensure that a bold positive vision for our future was implemented
last week we need someone who can appeal to and unite individuals who argued that we should leave and who also believed that we should remain in the european union and already today i've had support from colleagues across that spectrum and indeed from outside politics that confirms my belief that i was right to stand to offer myself up for election
while boris has many talents and attributes he wasn't capable of building that team and there were a number of people who had said to me during the course of the week michael
allow my colleagues in the conservative party to make a judgement about whether or not i am right to
over what happens within their own schools a greater degree of innovation and
to answer a few questions from david aronavitcher former colleague of mine at the times and also to
from a variety of state schools and members of the audience we're all passionate about making education
but i also like coming here because the students are so open and confident and polite and interesting and also the staff are
i think it's almost impossible when you're in the middle of making changes to know exactly what your legacy would be but i hope that my legacy would be more great teachers
huge day i always enjoy coming to wellington and there are a number of constituents of mine
people in political bureaucracies and they don't want to change because it suits them to deny
i've said that our young people just aren't cutting it when it comes to maths english and science so we need to change but there are
has a particular regard for us because he believes that he predicted brexit and at the time of that vote there were very few international figures who welcomed it as enthusiastically
the interview reflects a warm personal regard that the president has
i think he wants a strong relationship with britain he has an affection for britain his his
no i'm very happy being a member of parliament for sariheeth and a writer for the times but i think it's important to
but the times today carries that interview on its website in full and what we wanted to do is to make sure that people have the chance to hear
he is an electric personality you don't necessarily need to be a fan you don't need to suspect
wants to secure a trade deal and i know from the conversations that i had around my visit that when the foreign secretary went to talk to members of the trump team they enjoyed their conversations with him and they felt that he was an effective advocate for britain's interests and
i've i've been in government it's important to acknowledge as well that this was a shared interview it was
but donald trump had nothing but praise for theresa may in this interview wants to see
introduce were introduced in sweden in the 1990s after a recession and indeed in the aftermath of a banking crisis in sweden and yet they succeeded in making those reforms and i believe that we can hear and another critical thing about the sorts of reforms that we want to introduce is that by having new providers
at the moment is pretty bleak but one of the striking things is that the sorts of reforms that we want
one thing i would say however is that the fact the prime minister has answered the question the way that he has reminds everyone why he's our leader he's got the authority and he's
one of the ways in which it will help us win is that it reinforces in everyone's mind the fact that we have as our prime minister a normal sane decent guy who's in politics for the right reasons
and likes prime minister is people know that he is not interested in the office for what it can give him he's interested because of public service and he thinks two terms at the end of those two terms
during the course of any election you'll have all sorts of questions being asked about how long x is going to go
knows that one of the best ways in which you can establish your credentials for the top job is by continuing to be a loyal and effective member of the team and one of the
whom you've had to prize out of downing street their fingernails have been there in the doorjamb
to be a loyal number two but to be at the head of intrigue and that is not what we
the fact that the prime minister has answered a direct question honestly and you're in a state of cognitive dissonance
part of the meat and drink of political commentary what's really striking is that david has been honest today
answering a question directly as i have i've just said he's going to serve the full the full term the full five years and and i'm afraid
elected leader of the conservative party in the first place was because he was a breath of fresh air
clinton ronald reagan were strong executive leaders throughout their second term there is no reason why a british prime minister couldn't do exactly the same
as we saw last night the scale of what was happening and the fact that it was occurring on a to an extent that i don't think anyone anticipated placed a strain on the metropolitan police i think actually that officers behaved with amazing fortitude and resilience and courage but we needed more police on the streets
well there'll be time i think in due course for people to analyse what the specific factors were that led to the violence occurring in the way that it did but i don't believe that anyone anticipated that we would see violence on the scale that we have and the question now is that
to cause a greater degree of trouble than any of us could have envisaged so there is evidence and we are analysing what needs to be done but i think it's too soon to say that we have a total picture of what is inevitably a challenging situation that requires above all a security response
well you asked the question about disconnection i think that there will be time there has to be time for a proper examination of the factors that have led to the violence that's occurred
the leaflets that have been picked up that there may well be an element of
seek and to pursue should provide all of those who like me are angry at what happened with the reassurance of knowing that the prime minister is clear these people are criminals and they need to be caught prosecuted and jailed
we are in in some of our the new housing that we're building the 5000 new units some of them will be for you know for a larger family because that
there are 25 other people sitting with them waiting to build on the to bid on the same suite
they get it if there are this many units that are available for families that's a really important part of this process
one of the things that we can do is when we build rapid transit as we are going to in surrey and in vancouver is insist that at every transit station it be
important i mean it's so hard if you've got more than one child to try and find a place to live
can find affordable housing so that's a key part but remember you know really what has to happen is cities can zone this they can say you know you're i'm going to give you a permit jeremy you're you've got a you know a
once that bidding is over it's going to be really expensive for whoever gets it if there are more places to bid on
that's what i'd like to see is way more supply out there so that when you're in there trying to buy a condo maybe there's only one other person that wants to buy it because there are so many new condos that are available now for people to go after
give you a good example jeremy if you are i'm sure you know people like this because i do too
we have to keep our foot on the gas with education so it means we've got to make sure we're continuing to make that investment in people so that the people of this province are first in line for the jobs because you know
that most of the jobs will go to british well that all of the jobs will go to british columbians first then we'll go and look across the country invite other canadians to come because we simply don't have enough people here to fill all the jobs
and you know that seems to me to be a pretty reasonable tradeoff to secure a 36 billion dollars investment
there's little bumps in the road sometimes but it's been very positive you think 55 agreements 28 first nations that's a pretty good number we've got a few first nations with whom we're still working but they've all said they want this to happen and so when you're
these remote first nations communities to create their own economies and we all know that first nations in parts of this province have suffered for a long time i want to see them you know people in those in those communities going to work and getting an education and make sure their kids have the same chance as everybody else
all of those induced and indirect jobs are counted in that and they matter i mean those are
in the 1990s and that's why we had the devastation that we had all through the 2000s so as a government we devoted over 800 million dollars to battling them
which john rustad so ably chaired which gave us a good start in thinking about
i mean the other thing you know mr dixon didn't even mention
would have would forget to think of a talk about the pine beetle devastation when you were in prince george
we are going to have it costed and we are not going to do it on the backs of the people who work in the forest industry we are going to find a way to do it and it absolutely needs to be done and that was
you can expect more news about where we are going to take forest innovative for forest revitalization
conditions we are being and by the way we're be i think being quite principled being
through the transition process people will want to know exactly what the rules are going to be and how it's going to work it's going to essentially be the same as the old system and so i think people who have been established for a while will understand you know will have a good feel for how that could work i think it's going to be extra challenging though for people who have incorporated
one of the things that we're talking about is matching the federal income tax benefit working working tax benefit so it's for people who are the working poor to give them a leg up and it just it just adds straight to their bottom line part of it is intended to make it a better deal to work than to be on social
candidate in this race who isn't getting paid every two weeks by taxpayers in order to be a leadership candidate i mean i'm i'm i'm living off my savings while i'm doing this and i'm the only candidate who on the 27th if i lose will stop will still not be getting a cheque from taxpayers every two weeks so i don't know i mean i have to think about how i'm going to put food on the table for haymish
four years in government trying to clean up after those guys i spent some time in the private sector i mean i i haven't been on a track where i've i've spent it every day thinking gosh how can i be premier one day in fact if this if if gordon campbell hadn't have resigned i would have been quite happy to stay in broadcasting for many many more years
well i was deputy premier minister of education i was vice chair of treasury board i had all those three roles when the amish was just
your child is an infant they're consuming more of your time than in any other time in their lives i share custody of my son too so it's not as though i have him with me 24 7 as much as i would love to right but so it it's not as onerous as it was when he was little i'm not underestimating the fact that it's going to be hard though i know that it is and hamish knows
more important to british columbia than anywhere else and good on him he got it done he got it on the agenda
50 million people so maybe not quite that many but maybe 10
so pres president comes up in in a 100 days to canada for his state dinner
lot of us all of us we would go surely would go and talk to our federal counterparts and we would be all softwood all the time got it on the agenda and then you know
written down and so i mean i don't think we could have hoped for better out of the federal government on this they did a really good job and now it's up to us to work with them to make sure bc's interests are protected the negotiation will be lumpy and bumpy we know that it always is and
growing the market in india we think that's the next china and we're also investing in secondary cities i mean you know we call them
and we our assumption is they intend to have it solved by the time it comes up and that's great and the thing is about softwood a hundred days a hundred days
yes we have we so for the first thing i ever said to him when he became prime minister was we need you to help us settle ourself with lumber deal because we know it only gets settled by prime minister or president talking
yes and but we will we will get to a place where i'm sure you know it's not really satisfactory for either side but it's better than unmanaged trade and
sometimes you get the same thing by a different way we think of executive orders here you know memorandums here directives and and down here but the both president obama and president trump both like issuing executive orders even when they may not need to actually issue an executive order in order to get things done that they want to get done
put this in context because sometimes things get done in executive orders and other times they get done
who said that might have been one element in there that actually needed the force of the presidential executive order but the rest of it could have been
he knew and people whom he was associated with who'd done something that wasn't political and was outside the norm
liaison in a men's room near the white house i'm sorry not bobby baker bobby baker who had who had been involved in a bunch of shady dealings
arrows but let's not kid ourselves this is an effort to diminish the president by
a bunch of myths back when i was the senior advisor to president bush i had a biography written by two led texas leftwing journalists entitled bush's brain and
in a men's room near the white house these kind of things got tarnished president johnson because they were
bush would laugh and say better you than me and that's right it's it's sometimes it's better for the people around the president
look president bush knew exactly what that was all about that was about using me to attack him and many of these attacks on bannon
credibility of his opponents so you got to be careful about doing it i grant you that it's sometimes done i think it's i think we pay too much attention to how often it's done this administration is doing it far more often than other
and most of the time it fails unless there's something fundamentally flaw
out and attack bannon in order to make him a scarier karl rove and undermine trump i mean telegraph what you're doing and you know it's fine go off and do that
flexibility on things that i was worried about so he has a chance saudi arabia they're desperate to have a united states that has resolution resolved and determination to fight isis and to stare down iran israel our longtime ally the visit to italy may be a little bit more problematic because their politics is so upset but he's going to go visit with the pope we'll hear about it
security over to the fbi headquarters with a manila folder containing the letter nobody knew where comey was rather than pulling him into the oval and looking him in the eye and saying i've lost confidence in you it's time for you to go he sends that over that laid made him look petty
yeah and when you toss that time cover for me again that was really good the way you sort of flipped it out back
a message particularly spicer and shelley sarah huckabee sanders had a message in which they stayed religiously on a wednesday and thursday and then thursday the president blew it all up by telling lester holt well i didn't rely upon the rod rosenstein
in just a minute let me say about the about people being exasperated and talking about it to the press again they shouldn't be doing it but you can understand people are getting worn down because the president has put them sometimes by his own actions in places where they don't want to be take last week
without a scorecard deal and we break them down we got we got the non intel lead
you know i enjoyed writing chapter 21 i've gotten a lot of positive feedback on the chapters about 9 11 i've also got some good feedback about the katrina chapter from people in louisiana in fact so but you know i hope there's something in for anybody who reads
to do it with conviction and authenticity because people by 2012 are going to be
period that we have here in texas you can vote for basically five weeks which sounds good drive up participation but the effect of it has been to drive up the cost of campaigning because rather than the campaigns aiming to sort of
but but you know it's like for example i do worry about the lack of competitiveness in most congressional districts
the principal drivers for whatever reason people are more engaged and think more is at stake in politics 1992 was the key example because there was a significant increase in turnout from 1988 1988 is an important election but it's sort of the
well james carville wrote this wrote this in a provocative book in the spring of 2010 and that fall the democrats had a horrific loss in the election he said democrats are going to run things for the next 40 years i'd be very careful about making those kind of judgments
attitudes change and campaigns can actually have an impact on the attitudes of voting groups both within individual elections and over time
limit that if if if if we could to some degree but look i i i i i'm i don't have a magic wand on it
latino sounding latino he was an active republican here at the at the university of texas and worked as an intern for senator john cornyn you know we we we can't simply look at people and say i'm going to put you in a box today and here's where you're going to be 10 or 12 or 15 years from now
focused on getting the biggest vote possible for governor bush and we'll let the others worry about their percentages but our object is to get the largest vote that we possibly can for governor bush and hopefully to meet and exceed the record for the republican side of the iowa caucus which is 37 percent
he can do governor bush has actually done it he's the only one of those four who signed a significant piece of anti abortion legislation in fact national association for abortion rights says he signed 18 pieces of pro life legislation as governor of texas including a prendal notification law that's a model for the country so they can talk that's what campaigns are about but governor bush has proven record
john mccain has spent a million and a half on television and he's gone from 21 to 24 in the polls we
point strict construction people who are not judicial activists but instead realize that there's a limited role to the
he held a news conference today we'll hold news conferences and make ourselves available to members of the press every day that we're on the campaign
that's like saying that it really didn't matter that we beat the four minute mile because it was in english when it was 1952 if we beat the record we beat the record
not true and and what was interesting was the press reports then revealed that the forbes campaign admitted they were conducting push polls with negative phone calls to bush supporters saying would you vote for governor bush if you knew that and then proceed to trash him on his record as governor and tax taxes and education so but as to the original allegation absolutely not true there's an allegation a minute from the forbes campaign and this is just another one of them
52 to 51 so we feel very good about south carolina south carolina is bush country
i see him every couple of weeks for lunch and remains a great
but you also have personalities who rise up and capture their moment in history as president reagan did in 1980 no one else could have done that
my lack of attendance move the market or anything but i thought if you're going to be honest and sincere about how you feel then you probably ought to apply it to the convention as well
and of vision and of courage that is the human element in elections
and about problem solving at a local level that wasn't so complicated and a lot of what he talked about
you know pretty standard republican messaging but he took it a notch higher because he had it added an element of dignity
and it was a big tent that he built he was likable he was accessible
back to embracing that big tent concept and speaking in ways that are visionary courageous bold and representative of the greater aspirations of the american people i think we've strayed a bit from that
where it will be all for naught where you can have a person who meets their moment in history like in 1980 and rises up to capture the imagination of the american people and i think that's more the human dimension than the mechanical dimension of politics
which i thought made it the preeminent political party in the united states and so my in short my comment at the time was
it is a counter terror effort that we are waging this is going to go on for a whole lot of years into the future and not only in afghanistan
we have no choice pierce we have no choice other than to do home building right here in the united states of america
no i'm in the keep americans safe business we first and foremost need to you said revelation
at some point that may be something that we take a look at but i'll always be engaged in the affairs of this great country and hope to step up and help wherever i can
there's no question about that you have to be responsive to the the the the needs and desires of the voting population
and what that organizing theme is going forward i don't think anyone has established yet it might come out of this election cycle it may be counterterrorism it may be isis i don't know but right now in the absence of that overarching coalescence
second and if you don't meet market expectations you begin to atrophy pretty quickly
i'm a public servant first and foremost i always want to help my country where i can but you don't want to embark on a suicide mission
under the sec primary states which largely are big red states in the south in which he does relatively well so
but i'm not ready for a third party run until we have a complete collapse of a republican party that i can still believe
to get what they call the big mo once you catch capture that winning narrative after three or four or half dozen wins then you're you're off and there's very little that can stop that what i
until such time as we have a leader who's willing to work both sides of the aisle
we'll have to see given current rhetoric in the political marketplace the answer is no
his shadow as well as the shadow of this magnificent monument
from 10000 miles away is a picture of liberty opportunity and justice
every dollar of federal revenue will go to covering the costs of medicare social security
through no fault of their own something that is totally alien to them a sense that the deck is stacked
we must reignite the powerful jobcreating engine of our economy
secure in their rights and in love with their liberty
and i'm asking for the greatest privilege americans can bestow on a fellow citizen
our country will fall behind the productivity of other countries our influence in the world will wane our security will grow ever more precarious and the 21st century will then be known as the end of the american
we must make hard decisions that are necessary to avert disaster if we don't
i've lived overseas four times where the view of america
of utah when i was governor we cut taxes we flattened rates we balanced our budget we worked very hard to maintain our triple a bond rating status
they're joined my by my good friend paul chevalier a former marine and there we looked at america's greatest
let me say let me say first of all with respect to governor romney you know there are a lot of people who are tuning in this morning and i'm sure they're terribly confused after watching all the
i used to work for president reagan he said in the election of 1980 that we would cut our diplomatic links with beijing which had just been restored the year before under jimmy carter and recognize taipei as a legitimate
place to winning the election and then having to govern and dealing with the world as it is so at some point just like every president since ronald reagan in every election we've had the same
we're we're not going to come out so well so my guess is that sooner rather than later they're going to be
to a period of greater trust in our institutions of governance in our leaders and in our capacity to get things done as a country even across political boundaries
the north has blown off nuclear weapons without the chinese even being notified about
trouble i i've been around long enough becky i've heard this stuff before although as it relates to the one china policy this is a policy that both taiwan and china buy into so when you say that you're gonna make the one china policy a bargaining chip that that probably
recognize north korea for what it is it's a dangerous unpredictable almost suicidal state what we do know is that they've paraded an intercontinental missile
kind of a replay of what we've seen before trump at some point is gonna have to say i've gotta sit down and do business with the chinese i'm gonna have to cut deals i'm gonna have to work on security matters environmental matters even securing greater stability
our democratic nominee is for president we're gonna be in good shape because they're gonna gal
these races today the republicans have had to spend an awful lot of money trying to defend what typically have been slam dunk republican districts no one knows the outcome of course until the polls close but the fact that the republicans have had to fight so hard to keep traditional really republican seats is a very bad sign for them
here's where i agree with our presidential nominee but here's where i disagree
republicans because of their financial situation have embarked on what they call the millionaire strategy they're just looking for people with deep pockets to run and a person with deep pockets doesn't necessarily have that contact with the community doesn't necessarily know the issues that are important to people on the ground so
running earned the respect from people on both sides of the aisle republicans and democrats alike and is known as a fierce advocate for her constituents
well there is no magic number we've gone from a situation where most people thought that we would be on defense this cycle just
nominee is regardless of who it is if it's any of the front runners in those districts where their position on national issues may not be attuned to the issues that are important to a particular congressional district it provides our members our democratic members of the congress action an opportunity to say to their constituents
who could argue with over a million dollars and obviously in the house the republicans didn't even agree with their own speaker on a million dollars look the president as we all know
well john i think you know and we'll probably say the same thing on this until we know exactly
the interest savings and 1 point 2 trillion dollars in revenue they can't get that kind of balance
fact check first of all you got to get your facts right the budget that we brought and we did have an alternative budget that got an overwhelming democratic vote did not say we're only going to raise taxes on people over a million dollars it actually supported the president's proposal so you got to check your facts what we're asking for in the house is the same thing that the republicans
thousand should be the threshold as part of a larger agreement the issue is the balance between
look at the president's budget look at the president's proposal to congress september
that's proposing the senators couldn't tell us the details it's impossible to know it depends on the deal all i know is that democrats in the house are very determined to avoid going over the fiscal cliff but we want to make sure that any agreement asks folks at the very high income levels to pay a little bit more to reduce our deficit because if you don't ask them to pay a little bit more everybody else gets hit that much harder
in the house have refused even one penny so far from people earning more than a million dollars that is not balanced which is your position
just allow a vote in the house the republicans got a vote in the senate on their proposal
first thing the democrats did was require transparency and accountability under earmark reforms making sure that everybody had to take responsibility for what they were asking for we're more than happy to explore a greater earmark reform going
well i think we now know why they kept this secret for so long and i think you've just put your finger on what
and a two hundred thousand average tax cut for the top one tenth of 1 percent
and substance abuse those benefits are finally making some difference in these rural areas as well as the urban and suburban
billion dollars of tax cuts if you're in the one tenth of one percent you're going to get an average tax cut of two hundred thousand dollars if you're a millionaire you're
and those are exactly the people that you know donald trump went to during the campaign saying that nobody was listening to them
i think it's beginning to break up up from from all sides and the more people take a look at this the more they're asking the questions that we're talking about this morning and other
tax cut around 50000 dollars they even put in a provision here that provides tax cuts for the bonuses that insurance companies pay to their ceos so you add all that up to 600 billion dollars and yes the people who are being appointed to the trump camp
i i got to this is not what donald trump talked about on the campaign trail he talked about the issues that you and joe were just talking about the squeeze on working america
in the long term to medicaid but also the fact that the affordable care act benefits right now help people with opioid addiction
have handguns from other states that don't have those laws coming into maryland and increasing the homicide rate so we want to save lives by encouraging other states to adopt similar laws
too many distractions not enough training a pretty damning report there so i'm hoping metro will get on the ball and start implementing these recommendations immediately
report about metro from the fta laying out a series of directives that metro needs
know is that over 80 percent of the american public supports you
is it in congress you don't give up from the beginning right you try to lay the groundwork and build support over time to get things done everything we've done
well i don't know what the chances are what i do know is i will continue to oppose so called fast track authority and the reason i will continue to oppose it is it does not provide congress with enough input and
has many many serious flaws it's got a lot of shortcomings so as of now there's no reason to grant fast track updown authority to what i believe is a flawed agreement at this point in time
the hands of criminals people with a criminal record and people who pose a risk to the community so
to adopt similar provisions because right now although maryland has adopted
including the fact that it does not have a provision to deal with a currency manipulation
a tax tsunami about to crash down on the heads of the american people the amt is going to hit
he never never wanted to have canned beans you know he's got the fresh
pace you have to edit yourself you have to know where they're where they're where they're looking where they're not looking you have to have that double thing going on which is a real juggling act and has its own anxiety to it which is rather stimulating
it's not that you think that the laughter of the audience so much is that silences when you're doing even a
of every man tommy lee was every man and i heard heard him sing amazing grace on that stage and i was in a wheelchair playing good deeds and i did midsummer night's dream with like puck and we did trojan women
i think jimmy played paris you know but it was all very wild and
i don't like that sense of separation people have between i think in our country one of the problems is we're so big that it's really
kind of challenge and so that you're constantly made fresh
summer theater we did i mean i did like 35 plays in various venues
you say oh i licked i that that was bothering me that's oh i know what that means now and i mean i had
i suppose my first big break was actually in too jail in the verona which was then a musical adaptation that john guare had written
of his you know rummy mitchens in in major barbara we're not all talking
and that's about that time i got in a television movie called girl most likely to that joan rivers wrote which was quite popular
and i went up to him and i got scrambled out of this van and i said hi we've actually never met but i think we've been married for about 50 years
with and he obviously made this choice i'm gonna miss him he's a good guy and he's a terrific actor and i
weird to sit there you know and so
it was called a state dinner and they decided he should have a wife it was early on in the first season and they negotiated with my agent i was up in canada doing a movie and i had a couple of days off so they they literally the night before said it's going to work and i was literally going hiking
because i didn't have any you know it's funny with with television because you know with movies they they have campaigns they take out ads and stuff like that and people talk about it a lot like who may get nominated who may not and stuff but i think with emmy nominations it sort of one day it happens and i you know so you never know what people are seeing
this is to who calls me at five o'clock in the morning and i sort of when i know it's that day i said wake up at 430
he said yeah we got we got girls and then a grandchild i said grandchild
at the end of september in los angeles it's unbelievably hot and uncomfortable that there you are getting dressed like
happened and i certainly was amazed when i got to i was so gratified about the matthew shepard story
just the way the climate was so none of this really made any
step by you know it's just a movie it's just some success and you could go away tomorrow and then you have to figure out that
such a big hit but you know all the people who made studio movies were very snobby about it
sent me out to the studio and the hairdresser who was doing the test was it was her weekend so she sent her
i was and i have to say at the beginning it wasn't working out terribly well you know so for a while i didn't make any money and and then i got a my first big break was in a movie called the fortune for mike nichols
what is it for and they said the west wing and i i said oh i saw that show it's great and i had no idea what i was going to be doing i had no idea what the character
and it ended up in la and they both threw me into an evening gown and i i got on this
and then the second about a couple months later we've gone in the air and and then there are a lot of people writing in and stuff that did very well my episode so i had lunch with aaron and i said so what do we do now
i think maybe i think maybe you should be a doctor i said okay and that was how it worked
you know in those days at least which is a very long time ago people i don't know it didn't seem so
and i turn on television set and there was this show starting up the west wing yeah yeah and i stopped unpacking i stopped eating i started watching this thing and i said wow is this good this will never last
we did that this this spring summer and that's on showtime this saturday night so since i did on the west wing i've been able to do
i was in canada last september and i was working up there and you know when you move into a new place you order room service
bus to go to the set and there is martin sheen and white tie we've never met each other before in our lives we had no chance to rehearse or anything i had no idea who else was to be playing and i said i knew it was a great show and i went up to when i said you know hi hi i'm sockert i'm martin we embraced it i think we've been married about this
this is a true story i'm not going to make up anything i i couldn't possibly do that i have a friend
it was as much a surprise to them as it was to my friend i mean everybody was in this together you know they may have felt better right after
and there was a bus boy who was they were breaking in it was like his first day and the reason i knew his first day
but i i don't think i think it depends on the dog i have a dog a very large dog who was sleeping at the foot of my bed at the time and as a matter of fact i i was dreaming and i woke up and i yelled at my dog
i did it till i could get it right and then they say well give her the part in the movie which is pretty unusual so i i guess
but there they are and so at 4 30 in the morning julie wakes up and she realizes after the earthquake that every one of her 11 dogs in the house
i mean it's a tossup i mean after all i think that the cold you at least you get away from it it's happened you can bundle up unless you're caught in the street that is horrible but you know i think the worst thing about the earthquake is it happened once and now we hear that that could be just a dress rehearsal you know and it could just happen again this could have been like a runthrough there's nothing yeah
breakthrough it's great but then that was that was two years passed between that moment that conversation and when we were in actual rehearsal so there were you know i was waiting for the phone call for them to say i don't know how to tell you this but you know the script's great the money's there but there's just one little thing they want you know to play the part
well yeah up and down up and up then it goes down then it goes sideways and then whatever you know like that
is really what it's about it's about kind of it's like emotional bungee jumping and it's sort of a sort of a two character piece and then and a young man a younger man is involved and i figured you know i got a couple of years left in me to
the starting point for a first home buyer is to get a good job that pays good money
and and malcolm turnbull suggested a 100000 dollars guarantee so that is another example but look
apocalyptic scenario in the parliament in february saying there's a cyclone ripping through the world creating damage wreaking havoc on families and that was a justification for the second stimulus package and you see the prime minister is hellbent on a political strategy his political strategy is in a year and a half he wants to say hang on guys
he said that we're being hit by a cyclone on a number of occasions and this
let me explain this it's a pretty simple equation with the prime minister if you are in any way critical of his government
well i think it's probably too late and that's because a lot of families out there would have already committed to some form of spending or saving on the basis of the passage of the legislation
it's not my fault it's the fault of the rest of the world and in the in the process of doing that he's causing untold damage to the australian economy with his apocalyptic rhetoric and the fact that he is constantly talking everything down
well clearly unemployment is rising but kevin rudd and wayne swan are making it worse because they're rhetoric
end of the reforms then explain to me why a government would not accept the man unanimous mandate of the senate and just get on with the job
work choices died at 230am this morning with a unanimous vote of the senate every party labor liberal national greens 2 independents all unanimously voted to kill work choices at 230 this
david the september quarter nonfarm gdp last year was negative
you're asking us to give rolling numbers the government can't even get its numbers right so we have to work off their numbers we will give you full box and dice before the next election
6 billion so whilst all these numbers are deteriorating at their own hand and whilst we have europe heading into recession the united states anemic and china with slowing growth the government somehow expects everyone to believe that they'll deliver a surplus next year i think they need to tell the truth they can't claim the credibility
hundreds and hundreds of public servants wayne swan is unable to deliver a surplus we will do it because we are prepared to make hard decisions about reducing government expenditure and you will see our plans before the election
i have no complaint about that but wayne swan was just on radio saying that
no actually sorry virginia if you actually look at my interview with
the chopping block what i've said is we've got to reduce the public service and we'll do it through natural attrition over over two years
well because they're still spending money i'll just come back they're still spending money
said is we will reduce the public service by over 12000 if we are elected because the public service has increased by more than 20000 since labor was elected
giving the government an excuse the government gives itself an excuse the bottom line is they are spending like drunken sailors handing out checks for 900 dollars was dead wrong and it had a true impact on the budget because ultimately everyone's going to have to pay for it
are out there playing a song and you know ultimately everyone has to start to hold them accountable because ultimately everyone's going to have to pay the taxes
shift from individuals and from the federal government to the state governments because they're going to
is about raising money and the fact that kevin rudd gave everyone 900 dollars or most people 900 dollars sooner or later will come home to roost they'll have these tax increases medicare rebate cuts
the sort of thing that labor does and why is it under labor that we always end up with bigger debts and higher tax
i want to believe it i want to believe that it's true i really hope that it's true i really hope that it
well this is another broken promise from kevin rudd and it also significantly virginia
what is consistent we have consistently said that this government is spending too much money we have consistently said that this government is going to have to increase taxes and charges to try and pay for it now they're doing it and you know what ultimately we there needs to be proper scrutiny on this mob they're paying they're playing the media
embarrassed about the amount of debt that they are building up they didn't have the courage to say it in the speech last night they didn't have the courage to say it at a press conference last night
you know i'm very reasonable about that i accept that they're very difficult times the question is how you react and this government in very difficult times has gone on the biggest spending spree in modern australian history
kevin rudd is trying to verbal me and you know that's what kevin rudd does get get you know tries to divert attention from his own failings making allegations about others what i pointed out was when the labor party announced a 42 billion dollars package earlier
and they haven't got the courage to deal with it in the budget itself you know this is this is a ball and chain around the legs of every australian they are leaving every australian as of today with a debt of nine thousand dollars each and you know what natasha it will get worse because you can't believe that this mob will control their spend
and you know why because they're handing it out as cash in fact the total amount of cash that the government has handed out is about the same as what they say is the cornerstone of this budget 22 billion dollars on infrastructure the irony is that of their so called nation building infrastructure
as i said yesterday the hyperventilation and what is now hypocrisy is just getting a bit rich in relation to peter slippy
who made a massive contribution to the welfare of the community
that they seem to initiate on regular occasions in relation to parliamentary discourse
from as well as arm chips and chips from other manufacturers so we're embracing that and you see
so i guess if you think broadly about our company i suppose we compete most with ibm because they are
but because the company's strategy was changing i'm not sure they quite knew what was
and here's what i'm seeing and our partners are taking advantage of this which is
of their apps were written you know on windows so we remain
you're right i mean so one of the things that i really focused on when i came to hp and i've been here for about two years was getting back our momentum in terms of innovation and being a thought leader in the industry and that is of course in hp's
so our wireless lan product and networking is what every company requires to manage byod
lower but we we aim to get it around the world as fast as we possibly can are
we are really when what i have said to our organization when in doubt
as much as we can of all those products through the channel so our breadth is our strength and people say to me all the time
but we would be able to provide a spectrum of devices for an enterprise to most carefully match up that
so i'm going to run for governor of california and we're here today in fullerton california to make the announcement official
business climate in california creating jobs and keeping jobs cutting government spending and fixing education and the way you do that is through
well i'd say ronald reagan or pete wilson did a better job and you know the state was in quite good shape when when pete left he left with a 12 billion dollars surplus but i will tell you this is all about leadership and it's all about focus and i want to focus
to let california fail i refuse to sit by and watch what is happening to this state i love the state where i built
and you know what i think if you have a huge need to be liked actually
actually i think it's an advantage right now because the people of california and i have traveled up and down this state are really angry at sacramento they are tired of the politicians they're tired of the politics and i think they want someone with a fresh set of eyes who's created jobs who's run this
because californians they want california to be great again but they recognize that we have to change the way we do business here or we're going to continue on a slow downward spiral which no one wants
my husband became a doctor our two boys were born here and i think we can change the direction of california but it will take a different approach that's for sure
so let's take a pause let's make sure we understand the economic impact this was put into place when we had a 4 point 6 percent
so over the last year i've done over 300 campaign events many of which are open to the press and so i think i've been pretty accessible and what i'm trying to
rate today it is 12 point 3 percent and let's take a pause make sure we understand what we've got
in every way i know how is get the message out to californians you know people want to know what i stand for they want to know the approach i will take and that's what we've
to 11 percent he came with a surplus left with a billion dollar deficit
on those three problems let's get the right people working for the governor you know you're only as good as the people who work for you so those appointments are incredibly important you've got to use the veto pad and you've got to
3 things at 100 percent as opposed to try to do 10 things at 50 percent and in california what i want to focus
years of my career as results i know how to fix things i know how to lead and i tell you i think this is very very important and i think what scott brown showed and it was an earthquake i mean
you know in california and i can't speak as well for the country but in california this is all about leadership
we've got to go every agency every department and say do we still need
and getting people to focus on three things and if you are off doing lots of different things and i will tell you firsthand in politics the gravitational pull to try to please everyone is enormous and you just gotta have this
don't feel like the government's working for them that it's a problem and you know what if we can create the
can we use technology to do more with less what's fascinating about california for
to grow and thrive then i think people will feel a lot better about their opportunities and they've got to feel that the process is working in washington
and congress to lead on getting the cost down at the federal government here's the bad news we have a government we can no longer afford and we better face up to that reality and we better start trying to figure out how we're going to get it back into line with what we can afford
and you have and you don't understand the conditions that are required to create jobs i think it's a huge
you know i think the american people want congress to be accountable they want the president to be accountable
i'm a proven job creator i have spent 30 years creating jobs working in the private sector i bring the
with less and then perhaps our biggest problem is the public employee pension problem which is
for holding on to these big companies i don't need the credit you know what i've learned to
issues and and he was right i'm right we need more jobs here but here's the difference between
and then we're going to have an economic development team that's going to hang on to jobs here in california so that will
or we're going to run out of money in california so it's getting californians back to work
job with the right skills on the same agenda as the governor and we're going to all march in the same direction
more deliberately and importantly from an internal perspective we will more
and i had to make it was the very first decision i had to make and my conclusion was that we had to put the company back together and we had a lot of stable
a a smaller set of products that each management team will focus on and we will even accelerate the innovation engine fast
so we're really focused on what's the value proposition for the end customer as well as our partners and i have to say the partner reaction today and the customer reaction was universally positive because what they know is we'll be a bit more
what we know is that this is the right thing for not only our customers
rewards to results when you run a hundred and ten billion dollar company which is what i run today what someone does in the server business in france
also very importantly our partners most of you probably know that our products business we sell through value added resellers and distributors in fact 85 percent of our pro
and we are such a much stronger company today and so
accomplished over the last three years we have repaired the balance sheet so we went from 12 and a half billion dollars of debt on the operating company to 4 point 7 billion
and our reality the material world and we've come so far in so many ways but i think jim is struggling to come to the
interesting and unique connection with him one that we maybe will wait our whole lives to try and have just a knowing they see the world the same way
to go around and discover all of these new kind of secret hidden and sometimes dark parts of los angeles that
of who am i what is my purpose in the world and what's real what's the really real and trying to find ways to
in a very strange way rid himself of as much as possible and playing
giant kong when there's really just like a pink x that i'm looking at but i was i was amazed by like how much i could believe and connect even though there was nothing there
i think i was just more surprised by like how far your imagination can take you you don't know until you kind of push yourself to the limit i am used to working with more tangible things working with a scene partner but there's a lot of my job that's always been make believe this was just like way more extreme of course you know i'm trying to pretend that there's
you know i'm a big believer in storytelling and it's a form of activism for me and i'm just excited that i can make movies that are about things that are really important that ask really big questions and i get to do it in a fun movie with 3d glasses like that's my that's been my dream and i'm getting to live that dream
i had taken a photography class years ago and then with this movie i thought well i'm in these incredible locations my subjects are like these amazing actors that are going to be great to take photos of and it was just a way to get closer to who mason is and what she's looking for and how she observes people and then on top of it i got some cool behind the scenes photos
i feel bad saying it because it's like oh it's not like magical it's not like fairies follow me around everywhere i go now but
i think it might be i have been kind of wondering what i'm supposed to do with all of them at this point
to people been like i don't know what to do i don't know what to do and you're like just go just go and you're like i don't know which way to run like that's a problem
not what's happening right now i'm not and he was like i'm watched her on the field it's like i just threw a football for the first time there's no way that you like thought that i was like joking he thought that maybe i was joking to like trip up the other team but i really was just that bad i see it wasn't a move of any kind
and i was like oh it's before the football game it's before the super bowl they're not gonna actually have us play it's just gonna be like us talking and a camera kinda going around being like we're here and i didn't realize until i got there and they like handed me a jersey that i was like oh no and
i have this weird dream that there's some weird cave somewhere where if i place them all together like something magical happens like maybe they all fit together like indiana jones
hey you know how this moment she could look inside of himself and go should i run with this and look at me but he ended up just running immediately got tackled we lost the game and he was so sad the whole time he was like i knew larson was a secret weapon i really screwed that up it was like oh yeah you really screwed that one up
choked on these chips yesterday and i was like no no no this is how i'm gonna go but a words i go with that
makes molly feel very comfortable and he seems to be the only person in the school that is exactly who he says he is
he's so funny and charming and is really good at throwing parties and having a good time and
i play molly tracy who is jonah's character's love interest i guess that seems fair it feels weird to say that about him i don't know what he would say about me
to have watched the show before if anything i think it's an exciting chance to modernize something that was so good before that is then going to open a door for other people young people to see it i think that's it's always exciting to have something new that allows you to go backwards
i guess the molly eric relationship is the modern day version of of the typical going steady
i think that the concept is the same but the story and the people involved is completely different so i don't think it's necessarily important
and molly are both drawn to his his charisma and he's different and he's also so smart you know so many things we not not realizing that he's older and therefore of course he knows all these cool references that we don't know about like rain man what is rain man we're both like completely astounded
because we know what the outside world is like this is what they know and so this is their home
you're stuck in room and you know that you have a predator coming in every night
well it's finding a way to actually work with old nick instead of just
of the children and and that you've seen on the news but i do know that if for us room became a canvas for our imagination
gills that i was able to take into making room to make sure that i never got too deep it never went too dark and you can find ways to
to me but through the experience of traveling with it to different countries talking about it with different people i could see how this same allegory could mean something completely different to somebody else and finding all of these small new meanings in it has been such an incredible discovery along the way
of new talent coming in has been incredible it feels like
with conflict on set through humor that are much harder to deal with if you take them seriously so they've both been incredibly important to me in the way that their processes have given me so much and got me closer to myself
but laughter and tears are both release and they're both incredibly valuable i've learned so much from from amy and from judd and from bill about how humor is so important as a way of release but i do love crying too so there will always be both
i filmed trainwreck before rome and so trainwreck was this wonderful
being out in the world and seeing how a piece of art like this connects with so many people although the fame part is a little scary it's also quite warm and welcoming you feel like you have a friend wherever you go and someone to connect with
goodbye i guess to one type of being and i learned and really refined my sense of humor through that process and realized how valuable it was and it was those
20 journalist rupert murdoch is someone who has has sworn an oath of allegiance to a foreign country and he comes down here sends his chief of staff tells us how we can think he sacks journalists if they don't like what they're supposed to do and he attacks australian freedom now i find that objectionable as a citizen who has sworn an oath of allegiance to this country
well all i can say that's probably a good sign i hope they haven't sacked you already but any
in world war two my nephew squadron leader martin brewster let it was in interfet in timor i've got the right to stand in this country in the same
i've got the right to stand for parliament and to let people vote for me and 50 point 3 percent of people
well i've i've employed more people in this country than than news limited have and we've seen news limited sack
it's very difficult you know so all i'm saying is that i'm an australian citizen i lost my great grandfather in world war one i lost we had
fairfax voted to elect me the largest swing ever since federation of any politician
i'd i'd love to but i'd just say ginny craig should put twerking in her program it's helped me lose about four kilos fantastic
best for you to find out what you can do and that's what i've been doing so far i haven't found out what i can't do
i had five airplanes but i thought if i told her i had five she might think
she said clive she said you've got two arms and two legs like everyone else there's nothing that you can't do
first wife and i wasn't as sensitive as i could have been as a person i tried to do my best in the circumstances i'm sure a lot of australians are in the same way but i regret that that can't stop me going
a lot of money but hopefully that's a byproduct so you never should worry about how much money you make you should always worry about doing it for the right reasons
well you know i am who i am i don't think i'm eccentric when i look in the mirror every morning and have a shave i say am i looking at an eccentric person
i've had about 68 stoushes in my life in court and 168 of them
so i've got an email in terry smith that i normally use to communicate with my family members
and of course i retired from the operations in 2003 when the federal parliament
that that was somebody's email that i would have used that day to approve something
we've had three judgments in the federal court and the supreme court of western australia and in arbitration against these chinese
well how could you bully senator lazarus you know i've seen him play it state of origin he didn't take any bullying from the queensland fords
well nobody's made that allegation as you as you'll appreciate i'm very surprised at these sorts of allegations this happened in 1983 it was public knowledge it was gazetted in the par government
if you or anyone else believes there is something wrong with our company or how we approach this matter the the the matter is very clear they can complain to the ombudsman they can complain to the police they can commence civil action no one will do that why won't they do it because it's just gutter politics that the liberal party embarks upon because they're desperate
it's mathematics you see the nickel price at the moment is 3 dollars 75 90 percent of the world production cost is is above that and that's that's that's how it is you can't do much about that really
but none of those assets ever get assessed when they go to the rich list right but that's where all of our wealth really comes from resource assets they're in the ground
home to think about it my wife goes mad at me every every now and then but i have to live with that like every husband has to live with his wife going mad at him it's a great leveling experience you know happy wife is a happy life that's what they say
the prime minister out of office and i went off to china i got back on the thursday and they'd done it so fat people
she was so sick that she couldn't get out of bed so i'd left her 10 days before and not knowing
i think by the time i was 27 or 29 or something like that i probably had assets worth about 40 million dollars which i thought was enough in life and certainly is more than enough right but so i thought i'd retire but all my friends had to go to school and they all had mortgages so it was a pretty lonely sort of a
if i've got any power or influence it's because of the strength of my ideas not for how much money i've got that's what i would say
his daughter is madame madame lee who works for china power that we do work with now
i think that was a common link between us that we were each going through a difficult
before we started tackling all the resources tax mr rudd was at 75 percent
and pushes me out of the way so many people and many australians can relate to that but i'm fighting an everending battle to get there
and my wife said he's got more interest in flicking his hair than the australian people and i said i think you're right and she she said you're a bit of a weak bud if you don't do something about it
more on infrastructure all those people have done more than i have for the country i'm 59 years old i'm a billionaire why shouldn't i put my tube bomb in i'm an australian just because i don't live in new york like rupert murdoch who runs tony abbott's campaign or i don't bring over obama's media advisors like the labour party did around their campaign i'm an aussie why shouldn't i do it
well look you know the reality of it is that when i got the balance of power in australia that scared the major political parties and they decide they'll try to fragment our vote and have a whole lot of little parties which they've been successful at doing and they try to disrupt you then they've taken people are
are not experienced in life and tell them anything people are vain but you've got to remember you've got to be in politics because of the result you can deliver for the australian people nothing else history should be their only reward as politicians but don't be a politician give your wife a hug
every year say that the government says we need budget repair the opposition says the opposite then they change chairs for a while and do the same thing to deny the australian people what the true situation is
merry christmas koshy merry christmas sam and happy christmas to all of australia well what prompted it was my my health my wife my children and i realised that we needed to have a disciplined approach
that our budget is is isn't work isn't calculated the same way as the state government's budget are or in accordance with the national accounting standard it's just a mirage to every
i knew i could do it i'm on my way i'm not there yet i've still
i'm sorry australia please forgive me i won't let you down i'll be back by next saturday i'll be back to where i was and i'll be going for
and tell you it was my three year old daughter's birthday yesterday it was my wife's anniversary i went out to a good fresh french restaurant my weight's up at two kilos today
extraordinary what he achieved i mean he would go off into the jungles on these expeditions for two or three years at a time and where other men had attempted to to map and to to explore and never came back you know and
i mean i suppose you know it was very strenuous some of these locations we were going to and like i said we were losing weight so i was on very very little calories so i would get pretty fatigued sometimes
you know a little emotional sometimes frankly you know when you're starving yourself like that you know i find myself on a real emotional roller coaster sometimes i was sort of manically happy and energetic and sometimes i just had no energy and wanted to cry so just trying to stay as emotionally
i'm a little bit subsequently and obviously going to really like him he's a lovely guy
yeah i mean you know tom was the relationship with him my approach to working with him was sort of very gentle and nurturing and you know sort of i guess as fatherly as he would accept me being i mean we're not that far apart in age and yet here i was playing as father
a remarkable man and the more i got to know him through the research i was doing the more i fell in love with him and felt like a great sense of responsibility to bring him to get to the screen as honest
at least from our perception of who he was as honestly and as complexly as we could
i i'm sure you would like the idea of it is scary and you know there were certainly people that have
it was immediately apparent from reading the script the the requirements of this and not really the physical requirements didn't bother me at all it was the
enjoying as much success as he is right now i had a really great time with him and yeah he's a he's a phenomenal
obviously thrashing about trying to get back out and then he couldn't so he went to the next course of action which
the way to get something lodged in your ear like that is with a very powerful jet of water so bless the little
significant undertaking and then when i got into deeply researching the character just a sense of responsibility to the man i fell in love with him and was so in awe of what he'd done in his life
was something that you know i was nervous about and required an enormous amount of thought to figure out how to do that effectively but it was more the emotional
i am with you i knew nothing about him i'd never heard of fawcett which was sort of criminal being british and he's such an important part of british culture but i actually think that very few people know about him so i'm really grateful that we had the opportunity to tell a story in this film but yeah i mean like you said it was
it was going to require more for from me than i'd ever had to give
total gentleman you know because they don't you know there's not very much to prove and when you are a rough guy in a rough world there's
real repercussions to your actions you better think really carefully before you before you speak and before you act
gender to get that film into production as soon as possible and i was already booked up for
it's an origin if they want to play around with the origin of the motorcycle culture in america so
necessity to reinvent it leaves a lot of room for us to imbue
reimagining it and doing something fresh because obviously it's a story that's been told many times before and we had to
had to convince him that that would be a grave mistake on his part so so yeah i
competitive business and life's tough so you gotta fight for what you want go on ask me one more question
i really just demanded that he have a cup of tea with me so that we could get to know each other as chaps and i still honestly i didn't think he was going to give me the role because he didn't seem like a man who was particular
one night and i threatened there would be burglar with a machete
we're all on the same journey so you know that that's the that's the fundamental thing is that you have to try to make it as personal as possible
saturation i'd literally seen it 50 times and so i gave it a spin
no in fact in real life i've i've had to defend myself once before with a machete but thankfully i didn't actually have to hit the chap with it i got
things that are important to me as an actor hopefully will be relevant to you as an audience goer because
narratives and themes are accessible to or relatable to a younger generation
i don't think he had specifically an actor in mind who he wanted to hire i just think he was
it did i mean yeah there was there was a lot of physical requirement both in getting myself into the appropriate shape you know doing a lot of pushups and pullups and that sort of melod
something that you know something a bit different than than than the way sword fighting never been handled before but it was uncertain what that was so we did many many versions and each version required me to do an enormous amount of preparation so every time we'd shoot a scene it'd be like
i do literally nothing would make me happier than to come back and do another one of these films i think guy feels the same way but you know we only tell the first chapter of the story
the years between about six and eight i must have watched it 50 times and so i was very familiar with the arthurian legends and then my team
it did and just from the one line pitch that i heard of guy ritchie's king arthur i saw i saw what i thought that was going to be and was very excited but
i learned all of that from aidan and it always felt like a very grand debt of gratitude to him so i was excited to work with him again
since my late teens an enormous fan of guy ritchie's when i heard that he was doing this i just immediately intuited what that would be i could sort of see the vision for what guy would do and i thought it was quite exciting so i just i just went about pursuing pursuing guy and and seeing if i could get myself involved
i can do this this is ok so i i mull it over but because i'm a single mom i just really want to focus on her and make sure that i'm doing a good job first
because i was so kind of worried about the first and once she came i was like hey
i'm not it was a very weird thing i think he's very smart and funny and and and and i would date him but
i mean we went actually on a trip to see some ruins at the end of the island and you could just you
anyway and we went to austin texas and we got to fly i think you have the tornado clip we're like flying you know like it's very wizard of oz
me harm and hurt because he's adorable and i i am not otherwise you know taken in that way so it didn't cause harm and hurt but it
me because i was you know i was i know all the players so i wasn't confused the thing that
and all of the greek people were in the ocean nobody was in in athens at all they were all out on vacation they were just like all those tourists are coming we're leaving
she's like no i was like are you sure because it's ok i won't tell anyone
did a hollywood foreign press you know they run the golden globes and i did a press conference for this movie shark boy and i walked in and they said mazel tov and i was like
where they wrote that she gets set up on a blind date and she thinks it's with the man but in fact it's a woman when she gets there so the storyline is that she kisses the woman to see if she feels anything and the and the answer was no and i remember when we were doing the storyline and i was like
did i want to come so of course i said yes and then we went with the little group who was trying to campaign for new york and one of the reasons that we did was because we thought you know i think people in the world kind of don't realize how warm and multicultural new york is and we thought that it would be wonderful to combine the olympic world with kind of the new york that we know which is like you know every nationality we're not snobs you know we're very welcome
traumatized that they don't really want to live which is why the nursery is so important because there are other
i could give the green light right now i would i don't know why we're not making another one right this very second i hope we will i think there's you know weird things that go on with
i got her to daphne at the elephant nursery which is called the david sheldrick wildlife trust in nairobi and chaimu is now living a
that but there is i think there's two things there's a lack of awareness which is why
and they speak to each other with voices that sometimes are too low for us to even hear
programs with the community that we're working on where we're including them in the conservation of the parks because this really is their history and tradition
community keeps the fence hole keeps the bees makes money from selling the honey and it's kind of
daphne and the trust have raised 170 orphan elephants and rereleased them into the water
happening they might see an ivory bracelet and think isn't that pretty and buy it not knowing that this is actually driving elephants to extinction
three seconds the mother and the baby touch so when they see their whole family killed and their mother killed
i happened to be in the right place at the right time in 2009 and i found an orphan baby elephant chai moo
they really acclimate into another herd they create a herd of ex orphans which they didn't know would happen they didn't know what would happen when they started they don't really rerelease
we have a beekeeping situation which is really amazing because elephants are afraid of bees so we have this great program where the community
we love to see each other we're all doing well it's great but i think nothing in our careers really will live up
defend her friend in a way that we've never gotten gotten to see maybe a stronger maybe a little bit stronger
a very different tone you know we're all together for a lot of the movie as opposed to kind of being off in our own individual storylines we start off in new york in our
i think for for me and i think all of us the first couple days that we were in the sahara it was so surreal that it was almost hard to take in i mean you can see it on film but like the dunes just go on forever and just knowing that lawrence of arabia shot there and to think about us the four of us on camels in our outfits in the sahara desert like we just kept turning and taking pictures of each other
you know i mean i did have a stunt double thank goodness these camels are very very very high
i don't know it was just kind of a lot and it was i think our first or second day but it went well and then we put you know that man we fell on that man over and over again me and the stunt double he was a true
really higher than you expect so we had a stunt double but i still had to do it because you needed to seem real you know but i got to fall onto a mattress held by about eight men who didn't speak english they spoke french or they spoke arabic so there was some fear involved they were
probably had some kind of weird tennis shoe on when i was walking around going on my editions and i think they were just like who is this girl what is she wearing so for me it was not that different i was kind of jealous of sarah and
got to wear that crazy like mushroom looking wig but it was fun to do that and very real i rembember those days i remember walking to my waitressing jobs i remember my first apartment and i slept in the living room i had a roommate and for some reason she got the bedroom i mean it just comes flooding back
brad peyton is our director and he's very visual he's very visual it's interesting i mean i don't always get to work with directors like that because they usually do things like this which is not so much a female driven genre but he's he's very creative and visual and tuned in to kind of
dwayne's really really fun i think he's so different than i mean i don't really know what his perception is now because obviously he came from wrestling and then he's done action and then he's done more family fare and then he's done action but he's so
he's so down to earth he's so smart he has a great relationship with his mom i had to come down and study their relationship he's very
doing things differently in the visual world which is great for a 3d movie because i think you know
he's been working for a long time yet he has absolutely none of the qualities you would think of as someone who's grown up in the business
deliver that and at the same time he's really tuned into the relationships and the dialogue and you know he he's extremely patient and watchful and all the good things that you want in a director he's a sweetheart
you know you can be a kid one minute and be talking to adults the next but he's also just a sweetheart and pays attention
he's very self possessed without being precocious you know he doesn't ever have that strange thing like where he's been around adults all his life you know he can talk to
generous as a as a person and an actor and i'd met him before and i thought he wouldn't remember and he thought i wouldn't remember it was very funny but i'd met him before and he's very
i'm not here to make any announcements about the nba the nbl allstar game but i'm certainly willing to take that on board
local communities but also working with government working with the private sector you know sport's such an important
opportunity in basketball to do the kind of things i like doing in politics you know working with people
for us to look at bringing whether it's a n the nbl all stars or other types of special event matches to wollongong it's a great venue for that
i know our fans were disappointed last year with the tv deal and so were we and that's why we went back to channel 10 and renegotiated next year every sunday afternoon a a live game on channel 10 free to air and then on friday nights on
love of mine and so to bring that all together in one job well i'm a very lucky person
that anna bly's good friend kevin rudd decided to launch a leadership challenge right in the middle of this campaign it made it incredibly hard for anna
but let's look at let's look at the queensland result lots of people trying to draw analogies about what it means federally anably's labour government started to become unpopular about three months after its election when
there's a different story happening federally where we have seen a bit of quite a bit of volatility the prime minister and the labour party closing that gap on two party preferred and indeed she is ahead
wink and one sign give me have you seen the protest this week have you seen the protest this week those very same signs were there and a wink and a nod and clive palmer they're all out there giving approval to the
from that i think what we had there was a situation we have kevin rudd decided on his own bat and arbitrarily to launch a very nasty bid for the leadership and totally poisoned the waters there in queensland for anna blige
see this on the first of july when the world doesn't fall in just as it didn't fall in with the gsa
she is the preferred prime minister she's ahead of tony abbott there
hard environment for anybody whether it's julia or anna or wayne swan or anyone to carry
when i spoke to a journalist about the wine i forgot then but i'm now remembered and i've updated my pec
i suppose the question i have is maybe he didn't want to survive in office
minister's office minister kelly's office it suddenly became a solicited proposal and that is a powerful change it is a it
in that evaluation found that the proposal lacked any merit lacked any value for money for the taxpayer and recommended in a draft minute that the proposal be reject
you'd have to think if he'd done that he might have suffered a day or two of embarrassment but he would have survived in office
and ostensibly it was about something else i can't even remember but he raised the issue of australian water holdings that this was this company that was achieving good value for the taxpayer and its proposals were being frustrated by government and we should have a look at the proposal a look at it on its merits he argued
the good news is that with one candidate named keneally and the other named o'farrell the clear winner on the 26th of march will be the irish so ladies and gentlemen
remarkably what i think is most remarkable is tony and barry are wearing the same outfit
on st patrick's day as does having an accent that occasionally makes me sound
acknowledge the consul general of ireland and also to acknowledge minister francis fitzgerald for thank you for joining us here in australia for these celebrations well it is terrific to be back here at the landsdowne club i'm sitting there at a table with my political opponent with julie's politic political opponent
and last from kilkenny but it does help me get into parties like this one and it's for many reasons that i do feel at home here today
peace has broken out st patrick is performing miracles still yet again 1700 years later and
who told the irish echo that his irish background has given him an interest in social justice together with a capacity to talk to the limits of verbosity yeah that's true a facility with language and a tendency to tease and stir and as only tom can
on that note have a wonderful st patrick's day and i look forward to a wonderful lunch today slainte
give him a call so let me ask you about housing prices how much did you choke on your weight fix this morning to hear scott morrison banging on about rising housing property prices i mean if there was just something that the commonwealth could do about it
if the government found some way to deal with the retrospectivity say they you know pushed the change off for another
that coal mine seems to be very close to approval by the new south wales liberal government major
we're joined tonight by acting greens leader scott ludlam on a day that has been full of news about clean energy finance wind turbines and coal mines and
and then patiently explained to me the concept of risk and reward hence the
was bloodletting the cefc as the government wasn't able to kill it off outright in the senate now as i understand it this directive does
finance corporation because the government did seem to kick off clean energy week by declaring and directing
statutory body with an independent board are there any avenues open to the senate here
the prime minister have a point that those things that can operate without a subsidy
is that they should lower their risk profile but increase their profits now if i said that to my financial
have to come back to the government the cefc gets the chance to comment on it then it comes back to the government and they need to table it in the parliament for it to become legally binding will the senate stand by and watch while the government tries to interfere in the
one member of the abbott government who doesn't like open cut coal mines or at
elected politicians should be exercising some caution as people are taking themselves what is really into harm's way as they're protest
this interview and that's exercise talisman sabra i don't know who names these things but last week you expressed concern about this threeway joint training exercise with the us
people call it you know a zeitgeist but a zeitgeist is just for a short period of time i always think that was a moment and this is more than a moment this has been 14 years and it keeps evolving and i think part of the reason is is because it took so long to get
it's a double edged sword in some ways because you think i'd like to play other parts people want you to be samantha because they love samantha so much but there's i've been very fortunate especially in the last year to try and change that and take other roles and challenges but i will always love samantha and be grateful that she's been in my life because i could never i wouldn't be here sitting
it changed my life irrevocably being part of it i mean i'm i'm known throughout the world i'm known you see samantha's known i'm not known they but the
because they want to see their lives and they want to laugh at it and they want to be touched by it and that's what i think this show continues
but i wanted some kind of accentuation so we decided to have this terrific designer do these fingernails so i loved coordinating my fingernail polish or my fingernail attaches to whatever outwit outfit that i was changed into it was just an added little
very honest true way and that's why it's around it grows anything in nature if it
i was amazing i never felt in any kind of jeopardy i never felt frightened they were always there and if there was any pictures taken they were they were destroyed
i think that the way it's written for men and women and the way they interchange and and connect or don't connect is very truthfully written
the first time to sort of get the plot lines and enjoy it but then the second time you see it you think oh i forgot that costume or oh i forgot that scape in the background or it's just a real visual delight as well as fun
for seven weeks i don't think i have ever felt so far away from home a completely different culture especially if you're
for me because you know i consider it my work and i know when they say cut
except to prove maybe something to myself and maybe what that was is that i still loved it and i still needed to do it and that's exactly what
and i just didn't feel that i was up to it i didn't think i could pull the sexy gal
and it was because i was so young they all said well you're very talented but we don't take anybody younger than 18 or 21 in england so i just the the american academy said if you pass the exam and you have a high school graduation which i had i could i could go to the school
and i've realized that the way my life has always been and what i'm trying to embrace at this point in my life is that where i am is where i live so when i'm in new york i do feel like a new yorker when i'm in london i do feel like a brit and when i'm in canada i'm a cana
it's very clear but when i i can tell when people meet me for the first time that images are going through their head
part anymore i felt you know that's kind of and that was in 1997 and that doesn't seem like a terribly long time ago not to me
and knowing yourself knowing having been in so many situations in so many
understanding that you can still keep learning and changing and grow
level that is happening but it was such a supportive atmosphere it was in sometimes a scary place because we were going and and taking on subject matter that had never been seen especially on tele
similar ways you say ah that's what i think that's where i go sometimes it's a cautionary tale because we can all do with reflection from others and ourselves but also in a way of understanding and a personality a part of you which is already established and honoring that saying you know i don't do well in that kind of circumstance
bring an audience that brings us further as women it brings us further as as human beings really i mean we need to understand not just each other in a in a gender way we need to understand
a woman you know a questioning part of her a romantic side of her a very sort of ambitious male side to her and a kind of a fun adventurous side to her and all of those moods were
those characters but we never knew it was going to capture a moment in people's imagination
no one had really seen a character like her before she was sort of like a modern day aphrodite
oh we did not to the extent but there was paparazzi and there were a lot of people in marrakesh who know the show quite well and enjoy it they kept calling me samantha so i knew something was up
but that's why i think that we eventually came to morocco because i think it's much more liberal and much more open than other arab nations and they they love samantha they love the show they got the show they understood what we were doing most of our extras had never been extras before and they were sort of fascinated but completely bored by it after a while
on and off camera there's we've grown up together this has been
fantastic it was like going back in time when the series you know was four single girls
which was a little unsettling you know and also exciting because everything was new and different
yes in some ways we are definitely and sometimes we do
smart and ambitious and brilliant in our own way and compete with men as as a woman and i feel that sex and the city has really given four prototypes for women that make up one complete woman and that's why it's so easy to relate to what's going on for any given character
here's about 25 i'm bored with 25 it's like a young wine i hate beaujolais i don't want to drink it i think it tastes terrible i want a nice full body
no it's a great great honor to get this award and i am the fact that it has distinction the word and and the the
kind of relaxed attitude to work of really collaborating is what i think makes sex and the city so so
oh you're getting some kind of an award i think oh god my bad old i mean
the reality is that those investments that i am talking about those investments
mr speaker it's been it's been a long summer let's just go over what has been happening
our investments in the people of this province i know that the i know that the member opposite may not be aware but this morning the minister of education and i announced a program called experience ontario 600 young people across ontario
i know that there are still people in this province who are struggling to find a job i understand that mr speaker that's why we are making the investments
i know that the economy is fragile i know that we are working in a context of a global economy that is fragile but we are putting in 
after high school mr speaker to help them to decide where they might go whether they'll go to postsecondary or training or into a job is just
it takes a lot of energy and a lot of organizing to put your name on a ballot to win a leadership and to get here to take a seat so congratulations on that
to add to that that one of the things i heard in the round table was very much that students want to be involved in the formation of those policies and so
ontario and you know it really changed the way i think about the way our society works
somebody said the other day that it's the best time of your life it's a hard time of life as well because
yeah that's a great question i i i have felt very much in the
international women's day so march 8th and part of that will be how are we going to make sure that there are the right policies in place on college and university campuses queen's has done a lot of work
that's something that i that was a very important takeaway for me it made perfect sense to me and
young people they're under a lot of pressure so whether that's whether that's mental health or whether that's career
human interaction and it led to my master studies which was
its uniform across the across the province and we'll be making that announcement at the beginning of march
i mean i think you just look at what i've said about making investments in infrastructure making sure that we have a strong publicly funded education system that we have a new vision for education like i i've been pretty clear about where i think we need to go i've said i'm not going to cut in slash i've said we need to make investments
debate if you want a window on internal discussion what is that line when does
a lot of kind of prefabricated back and forth that is is a sort of person
think vicious attack does work i think that it turns people off and i think one of the reasons that we have a large segment of the population particularly young people is that they hear
you know the fact is i see politics differently i see our path forward differently than tim hudak and andrea horvath do i'm concerned at some of the stuff that tim hudak's talking about because i think he's going to pick a fight with labour with teachers i think he's
he's dangerous i don't know what andrea horvath stands for i think that she's been very unclear on some issues that i would have thought the ndp would have been clear on same
it's not for me as the premier to decide who represents
negative advertising i really don't like it and so what i've said to people is we have to contrast you know we have to demonstrate how we're different from the conservatives and from the ndp but i i am not interested in attacking human beings you know i'm not interested in attacking
think vicious attack does work i think that it turns people off and i think one of the reasons that we have a large segment of the population particularly young people is that they
look at what i've said about making investments in infrastructure making sure that we have a strong publicly funded education system that we have a new vision for education like i i've been pretty clear about where i think we need to go i've said i'm not going to cut and slash i've said we need to make investments and i've i've taken the federal government to task for example for not partnering with us on on making those investments
well prepared for that i mean every every time we've made a leap and i say we there's been homophobia that's come up and we've had to deal with it as a as a couple and she to be fair she was out a long time before i was you know and she dealt with in the corporate in her corporate life she dealt with it in
as the trust of the council and the people of the city right so right now council
and you're talking about politics and how important it is that people care
he's dangerous i don't know what andrea horvath stands for i think that she's been very unclear on some issues that i would have thought the ndp would have been clear on
very clear about our plan we have brought a plan to the people of the province we introduced a budget last week that laid out a plan for investment in talent
that it would have been a very good idea to have worked to find a willing host like napanese
very important question and i think what it what it points to is that
the the population has grown so much i used to drive you know my family would drive from
towards that balanced budget at the same time we need to keep our schools strong keep our health
the the jobs and that's i think that's going to become more of a problem if you look at mining the mining 
and they are talking about moving up the plan to
because right now we have an economy that has jobs that are available but we have a labor force a workforce that does
school boards everyone from the education sector and we will work together to develop a new way of bargain
authority okay it's the group that has a plan for transit all over
be in trouble because he saw what was happening in the auto industry so we actually started
full range of human issues get dealt with you know what we know is if there are more women in politics then
and working with business to find opportunities for young people in a systematic way to have
investing early and that meant there were jobs that meant people were working and we kept the economy going so we have done better and we we should be very proud of that and there's still more to do
their goods around and have solid environments to work in the other thing that 
i i just want to add that i'm very aware whenever i
learned everything in that year and it takes immersion and total immersion of course is a crucial part of that i also had wonderful experience of studying with arlene o'shea great american soprano who gave me so much and was so extraordinary as a teacher along with fantastic coaches and
within six months of course i felt a tremendous amount of comfort it took that long really to feel comfortable in the language one of the things i love now is that having that foundation in the language and also studying lidr all
you're filling out an application you're doing your best be imaginative try to challenge yourself in terms of what it is you're setting out to do and
as opposed to simply being from one place i mean i never left this country really until i was in my 20s until i had this grant so it's in for a young person who's from somewhere where they don't have the opportunity to travel like my children have with me it's an amazing gift
need to concentrate more on the psychological drama and what's happening between these characters
i'm really grappling with this issue what in life is important what are should my priorities be right now
hugely because it it made me sort of unhappy i mean you can't win approval from everyone all the time and if you need it all the time then obviously you're not very ha
it it was through my own inability to say no and my own inability
fortunately i i think i do but i do a little better now maybe not a lot better but a little bit
am i giving my children enough time or
smoke in the bathroom wear nylons and get in girl fights there were these girls who would fight in my junior
i woke up one day and said this has been fun i i've accomplished a lot i've done a lot already in my life and i really want to look for a teaching job in some place and and live quiet and and raise my children and and be a mom
my schedule to a a reasonable place there was one year it was not a year it was actually 13 month period in which i was scheduled to sing 10 new roles
and i would literally befriend people who didn't have that constraint to try and learn about them and try and
graduate of the this school who was expecting a baby
when people said where do you like to sing the most i always said the met because it was my home
long gregarious experiencer of new thing
soprano they're young women you know they're sort of between the ages of 17 and 25 and so even if my voice can still sing these roles really well which some of them i can still sing it's sort of
when you start out the ambition is powerful and it's a driving force and you have a lot to accomplish and and to get there
the physical resilience so if i sing a big performance i don't want to do it again the next day you know it's like we are the weightlifters of singers and so that's
i i think it's it's a really wonderful place to be to begin to think about okay what do i want to do now
to achieve and to get better is also sometimes telling you you're not good enough
heard about the the you mentioned that the sports connection i think a lot about the olympics and how people keep breaking records and and and are there more violinists you think who can play with that sort of
born too soon but but he was the ultimate virtuoso and by virtuoso i think that someone not just has a good technique and plays everything perfectly someone that tosses it off like it's easy
listen a lot to the performances of chrysler paganini did you think a lot about their performances did you carry them with you on stage are they a are they a burden are they
you're about to play one of my favorite songs and one of the great great songs in all of the literature none but the lonely part of tchaikovsky and i was wondering if you think about singers do you think about breathing you
but i've lived with these pieces enough that i sort of feel like i own them now
of it out at the amount of notes you play at the the perfection and the intonation of it what is your relationship to virtuosity in general
and he wrote music that celebrated the instrument and and saintsans did the same actually saintsans wrote the introduction to rondo capricciosa for sarasate who was sort of the successor to paganini and he was another one of the great ricciosas but i listened to them as a as a kid
he was had the charm of chrysler i've never heard anyone with that and and so i'll never live up obviously playing his music to him but but but that so it's not all about all about just the athletic athletic nature of playing music it's just a small part of it as you know
in that moment we're being judged we see that as so negative in a sense when in fact the minute you're on the other side even in the audience even when i'm in the audience we're well intentioned
mix up high that that i find dangerous if you don't know how to do it
then you can be helped with it but i can't do it for instance i i have no idea i have a break and then
you don't push it out because that's another problem it will collapse but slow
if you if you if somebody sees you and you do a big gesture on that top note or you do something that's suddenly where it doesn't feel comfortable or it sounds tight or feels tight then it's too much anything up to that is probably great
classically trained singers i think for us it's so risky we tend if we have have swollen folds we tend not to to we tend to cancel
good yeah so you always want that total expansion and the mistake we make
windy day and everybody's clothing everything is flying all over my hair never moved not a single
of volume but as actors one of the problems too is that everybody needs to sing in a more popular
singing a long phrase or a high phrase or we're thinking about power is to collapse all that
which makes for a harsh sound or a tense sound or a strident sound
that's why it's not just lower breath it's also the rib cage so for me
help anybody if you can't perform when the time comes so that's that's really the secret
i have to very much avoid loud places i have to be careful about going to restaurants going to places where there's a
when he was practicing and he said renee you have to teach me how to sing
cambridge at some point to see steve and jane jonathan and the hawking children they have been so kind to us the whole way through this process and it's i'm one of those people when i watch a film i believe what i see on screen and and so our responsibility to tell their story truthfully and authentically was
that i sort of wake up in a few days and go did that did that happen
huge fans of those them from old and yeah i they learned a lot from them from watching them daily
workwise i've always had a fight for the jobs and and fought pretty hard for them certainly for the theory of everything and so as far as where you go from here i just retaining employment will keep me very happy
next 10 years do you know i wish i wish i could say that there was a plan that the interesting thing is the danish girl the film i'm shooting at the moment was a film that tom hooper who i was working with on les misrables he gave me that script then and so
how did i feel how did i feel i don't i mean the fact that it was cate blanchett giving it i mean i i did a film called the golden age elizabeth the golden age with cate and it's one of the first films i did and i just think
the film we knew we weren't going to be able to shoot chronologically so we're going to have to jump into different stages in stephen's life and within the same day and so i i didn't want for stephen
playing yesterday and i go back tomorrow and i go arrive on tuesday morning and go straight onto set so this
she was so calm she i was hol i was holding for a bit while she was being really calm and she cried and i gently
no and it's that hilarious thing by which when before you're a parent you sort of hear people talking about that
it's set in jk rowling's wizarding world it's set 70 years before harry potter and it's about this english magizoologist
yeah so we which was so we had this fan event for fantastic beasts and we were all there and then
hannah was totally on time but the but the baby was late and so iris appeared in the world and i gave her a stern talking to yeah
jk rowling arrived which was again a complete shock for us and whenever she comes we we turn into sort of excitable children and
flying and of course we were on a flight with basically most of the british olympic team and there was this fear that what if she cries lots and then they don't sleep and then they blame all of their lack of success
at three o'clock in the morning and you go in and you're sort of gently furious and then you get a little smile and your heart breaks a bit and it's totally worth it
i know we went to the olympics when iris was like eight weeks old and it was it was the most sort of astounding invitation and
scripts it's just the dialogue that you see but when you read her script it was like reading one of her books the intricacy of the detail and it was like you were taken back to all those things that you kind of love in
and i remember doing it was when i was just starting out and they were in this photograph there was a sort of there was a a model and me an actor wannabe actor and a
and mario tostino who i'd never worked with who is one of the most extraordinary brilliant people but he's just almost in that moment he was almost like a sort of parody of himself so
i'm huge fans of those them from old and yeah i they i learnt a lot from them from watching them daily
that love story and story about authenticity and bravery and so i'm really in the middle of that project at the moment and it just i was filming on friday night
illness was of very little interest to him after he was diagnosed he's someone that lives forward and lives passionately and that
got plane yesterday and i go back tomorrow and i i go arrive on tuesday morning and go straight onto set so this feels like a wild weird dream that
cambridge at some point to see stephen jane jonathan and the hawking children they have been so kind to us the whole way through this process and it's i'm one of those people when i watch a film i believe what i see on screen and and so our responsibility to tell their story truthfully and authentically
i mean i i did a film called the golden age elizabeth the golden age with cate and it's one of the first films i did and i
how did i feel how did i feel i don't i mean the fact that it was cate blanchett giving it
an exceptional actor and so i was recovering from that excitement of seeing her and then then just trying to bury all this frenzy of nerves and white noise and try and speak articulately and of course you then forget everything but it just felt like a euphoria really an extraordinary euphoria one like there's something i will not forget now
and and and so there were loads of elements of of the moment where there's a moment where colin is at the house that marilyn monroe's staying at and he goes to the loo in the middle of the night and sees her sort of looking
who's written as many diaries as he did he wrote two pieces the prince the showgirl and me and and my week with marily and and as an actor that's a kind of amazing resource because you have literally moment by moment documented so that was fantastic and i think it was interesting because on the set you had michelle
ask i was just sort of in the zone but it was wonderful one of the great things about this film was we shot
an excuse to sort of indulge in that and and i had no idea that she was as formidable an actress as she was people often say that
windsor castle we we apparently got permission from the queen to shoot outside outside so the moment when we drive up to the gate that was that was windsor castle no i think it was
how often those performances that look as if they've they're sort of you know completely free have taken a vast amount of work so
a few months later and i went up to toronto where michelle was shooting a film and we did a screen test there and a
and that's amazing because you walk down this one corridor and you have sort of marilyn monroe tottering down you then have a sort of dismembered pirate and a you know and a sort of sort of french parisian something or other so that was that's the stuff that make dreams are made of so that was so that was great
well there was one anteater who who was newborn and she had this habit of sort of
it comes from generally learning i guess about the foundation of this country
that that truly are different than anything else the world has ever seen and we need to understand that that is what has made our country what it is right now and if we move away from that we are going to make the same mistakes that many other countries have
that is where we are going to move away from that foundation and that basis and we'll have no consistency and anybody knows that that there chaos occurs when there is no consistency in government and when people cannot trust the government because they don't even obey the laws and i think that's something that everybody needs to really focus on is understanding that we have to do the right thing we have
absolutely whatever the labels may be absolutely i do think that all of us should be much more focused on that because whether you agree with the things in the constitution or not everybody needs to realize that we all have to obey the law
agree with something that's in the constitution we need to go about amending it but you have to do it the right way you have to follow the proper steps we can't just say well i don't like that law so i'm not going to listen to it you know we have to focus on on no one is above those
but really a lot of things about myself i've learned that i can stretch my limits beyond what i ever imagined
year of course and seeing my face on the big posters and on the marquee in front and all of these things
do in the country this year especially with the focus on obesity as well as eating disorders as well as health issues in general
community service find ways to volunteer find ways to reach out and lend a help
of a balanced healthy diet in moderation living a healthy lifestyle and that's what i've been trying to
that are doing amazing things and you realize all the good that is happening in the country and you start to let go of that sense of hopelessness and despotency
into an even broader campaign to focus generally on health nutrition wellbeing
so my dad made it very clear very quickly that scholarships were going to be the way to do that so
possible i've learned a lot about society and the country as a whole as well my patriotism has certainly grown stronger because as i've traveled this country i've found so many incredible
when you do that you will find how much power you have inside of you to make
right well it's a very strange feeling because i remember walking in last year
service and volunteering i found tremendous confidence and self esteem in that
last year i spent my 18th birthday at the super bowl and so i was trying to figure out what i
fitness special skills and an adventurous journey it's an incredible award and then
grad first which will be next year so there's a lot of years of school ahead but in the future we'll see how everything goes
all all about this award which really does do the same things that the miss america organization really focuses on with survey
actually after i'm done with my years miss america i'm no longer allowed to wear it only the current reigning miss america
days with his royal highness prince edward because the duke of edinburgh award has
your creativity out you know and that's what's so fun about it is i encourage anybody to find those things that they love to do and make things out of it
and now new york with events with the prince it's been absolutely fantastic we had many different events in baltimore with
having the experience that i need for it right now and i want to all the more now
was that i needed to focus on what was best for me and then not worry about the rest and so that's really what i try to help especially young women realize that to be success
the weight it's not about the numbers it really is about leading a healthy lifestyle and making those healthy choices because that's going to make the biggest difference in the long run
youth service america and so today we're headed over to queens working with a group of students who are going to teach me an authentic filipino dance as well as they're going to be making some healthy filipino food we're really focusing on hitting child obesity
to be accomplished and to even win miss america you don't have to do those things that so many people are telling you to do
right i think that so many times especially young people just don't see that enough they're not involved in it they don't understand they go to the store and food's always there but why is it there we have to understand why it's so important that we do continue to support agriculture and farming
talking about getting active eating healthy food and we're gonna have a fun time today
without ever having to hurt yourself or look down on yourself for the way you look without trying to be something you're not it's about being the best version of yourself you can be being the very best that you were made to be not trying to look like the per
a another project that we've been working on is really focusing on agriculture and farming working with the hand that feeds us and talking about where it is that our food comes from why agriculture and farming is so important why that is the heart and soul of this country and coming from
looking down upon us way and so that really helped a lot because i felt like i was learning from them and not being intimidated by them but just being lifted up and encouraged during the week and so you know with with an age discrepancy you have to make up for it with experience intelligence or maturity
no 17 year old had won right because it's kind of hard to be 17 and graduated from high school and still qualify for your local and your state definitely so the timing worked out perfectly with me it it was about two weeks there that i had to compete but it worked out but no other 17 year old has won since 1937 although in the beginning of the competition there were very very young girls
well honestly i don't know how it was in years past but this year i really felt that the whole group of girls were extremely supportive and encouraging of each other and that helped a lot because even though i was in the younger group we were like little sisters
i would wear it for any part of the competition but we opted out of that one
glad i had that experience and kind of had a taste of both because i think that really helped in the long run definitely helping me understand different kinds of people and all sorts of
and they do well through the middle so it was fun but i'm close with my siblings and we always had a crazy
i'm the middle so i've got three older and three younger and so it was always interesting i think it's a good spot to be though when your parents have kind of learned through the
year long when we're we're traveling all over the country and the world as well we will be wearing everything by joseph ribcov it's really great that they sponsor us this year it takes care of a lot of
about exposing their style their company to the world and so it's really neat to be able to do that for
representative for them their fashion correspondent so representing joseph ribcov is really incredible for me representing younger women also which their company does a great job of appealing to all ages and women and so it's really neat to showcase that as well
like barely covering i would definitely vote for the longer one but you know call me crazy i'm oldfashioned
the sun just now came out so i had to you know use the shades which i'm i'm glad i decided to bring with me but it's been really cool there's a
i'd well i guess one kind of in the middle would be best because if you have a really long one with the train and everything there's like people stepping on it that's no good but i guess it kind of depends on your definition of a short dress like you know
well we definitely had a heck of a voting campaign this year especially through twitter and i don't think we really had as much of a platform to do that
you know i actually i had to watch twilight for the first time to to finally understand exactly how to act like edward so i only watched the first one i didn't i didn't continue on but a lot of it was the makeup and the hair that kind of really put it all together you know
well it's it's been really cool and hot is a word to describe how i'm feeling right now
it was my first time wearing guide liner which was really weird for me i found out i have this horrible reflex where as long as there's like a pencil right next to my eyes my head goes like this
basically the thank you i i honestly i i struggled a lot with it this year because i didn't want to do the same thing over and over and over again but heck i like them
farther and farther back and my makeup lady was getting so frustrated she was like hold your head still
i think the one with mrs obama was probably the most meaningful to me because i'm i'm very interested in the military so being able to do something that was kind of a direct thank you to our to our families in the armed forces i think was one of the coolest things we could do
that's the only thing that i was thinking maybe like the slime would have to be tested first or or something but yeah i certainly hope that they're able to pull that out
unreal experience ever just going up there on stage and and how loud it was and how much energy everybody had was
absolutely i would i would definitely hope so but i mean we have some really stiff competition this year so and now we're nominated against victoria so we got our sister show to compete with you know i don't know i'm i'm hoping that we can make it you know three is a three pete i don't know if there's a special term for four but hopefully it'll be four whatever that is
just my memories from the very first kids' choice awards after icarly had aired so people actually knew who we were that was that was just really
surreal you know the the fact that that many people cared and that many people were fans definitely our first win was probably the most
so you know having having all these awesome people as part of the show is really
i think my favorite thing is whoever they get to host every year because it's always somebody huge and and having will smith as a host is going to be amazing and we have some awesome performers we have one direction and katy perry who are two of the biggest groups out there
narrow it down one moment we were moving around so much that it was
the first time we the night before when we first got to san diego before comic con we introduced a couple of fan screenings for the movie so people got to see it for the first time the next day at comic con we did a forum that was headed by zachary levi for for his foundation
just as a general note comic con was absolutely nuts it was everything that i believed would be described to me and more the costumes were insane
from their fans yeah so they i had been a fan of it for a while and i tweeted about it during the second season and they saw it got in touch with me and asked if they could write me into to the last season as a new villain character that they were thinking about
so props to them but it was cool because that's that'ts kind of the genre that i want to get myself into so it was really good practice in a very friendly environment of kind of the the place that i want to end up so that will be coming out in
wrapped up a a web series that i had been a fan of for a while called
so it not only did they have to do it once they had to do it twice completely out of their environment the second time and i think that is a feat
phenomenally intense and emotional scene without being in the water just standing in front of a microphone it's it's hard enough trying to match your words just in a scene saying stuff but to have that emotion too
and i we went in and did a chemistry read because actually i i auditioned for max's part i think most of the younger guys actually probably did
yeah it was it was very cool it's very stunt heavy and i got to look awesome and and they edited it together where i'm actually way more talented at it than i actually
i genuinely don't think that i could do that that took a phenomenal amount of skill and both of these guys had to do it for the entire scene and you would never know
a web series that has gotten phenomenally popular on the internet they have crowdfunded every single season they've done so far and their season 3 raised almost a million
yes i'm also a licensed driver so that may have had something to do with well
so she thought it would be disgusting like some kind of concoction or brew or nastiness and it basically just tastes like
you know lemon lime soda so it was good but yeah that was really fun getting to hang out with you guys because normally we just hang out i like promo
stuff like that where you know now we're in like a professional working environment so it's kind of cool to see that little aspect of it and i got to ride a segway type vehicle which was cool and i never wanted to get off of it you
oh yeah you were puking all over the place and then i got her ginger ale and it made it all better but she didn't want to drink it i know you did not want to drink the ginger
i just did an episode of csi and it aired march 11th it was really fun i got to see the rough cut of it before it actually ended up on tv and i'm not gonna lie it was actually really lame because there was no like sound effects or music or special effects or anything so it was really like a a skeleton thing and when i saw it i was like is that really how it's gonna
which is like me walking all over the place and like introducing kids to the paparazzi it's gonna be like rock band
your status stuff where it's like i got to sleep in till 7 30 this morning i'm serious
i don't know what i'm gonna do for my senior year i think i think i'm gonna take like
hard classes ever so that i can just kind of like have fun my senior year and not you know maybe have a little bit of a social life that would be nice and so yeah we're gonna be working all through the summer
or hear the voice of d bradley breaker baker who are all really great people and it's just
this whole movie follows the perspective of several different angles as we start out it opens on this this collection of time capsule videos being recorded for the town of silverton to be open 25 years later and as we progress we see who it's being shot by donnie and trey and
i watched silent films of the time that the producers kind of put on my lap on my lap
what what's become very apparent is so many people have their own opinions on things and we've thought
it's a different world and it's a world that i can't fully relate to and i never will be able to relate to so as an actor you kind of have to
very sort of yeah it's a it's a great feeling really really happy to be here it's my first time here as well so it's an opportunity to kind of see a new place
for you know well fortunately nothing has been that tragic in my life at the same time i think
bringing the world together in whatever capacity and people are having their voices heard now more than ever i mean my character's job in the in in the film is is is is is to kind of galvanize those people to make them realize that that you know they are worthy and
which was something again that that that kind of threw me out of my comfort zone and i knew that this would be challenging in its own way it was a sort of a unique way it's a unique
sort of powered whilst a lot of men were away fighting and kind of serving the country in that way it's it's about a young woman who serves her country becoming a writer for for the people
witnessed and and watched and and read about you know every single man that lived through that time i definitely
bad things happening and i i think it's sort of a an uplifting
he and i have kind of nearly worked together a few times
i mean the very first time we we meet will we see him a small
just wanting to comfort someone and not being able to i think but trying to soothe them with only your voice is the only sort of tool that he has the only
understandably he's in a he's in a very very dark place and so when will first is introduced to lou you kind of imagine that he's had the best care the best
however many hours of the day was a lot more challenging than i i once thought it would
been incredibly challenging and i think i think actually during the audition process i that was when i was first sort of in
who he is and who he was before the accident
talk openly and talk honestly to someone who's disabled purely because they kind of see
good time as well as working hard and i think we have the same mentality when it comes to work is that we want to have fun but at the same time we want to make a good
thing that he has going for him and the fact that will you know will will's brain is very very very much still functioning the way it always has and he's very very bright
because i can safely say that you know it's quite inspiring there are so many inspiring stories but there's so many hard
two of them together there there there's she's the first person who speaks her mind i think so many people are afraid
boyfriend especially i'd be like oh do you wanna you know we should totally be friends oh my god we should write letters
i was a comforter i was a comforter and it worked never it never actually
continued talking to my friends who i could have just stayed and walked home a bit slower and we could have had an actual conversation but there was something so unique and new about using the internet back then
and then and then once the boyfriend split up i'll be like you want to cry
in love by beyonce and we were like has this brought out like ten years ago
i'm sort of proud of him really it it it was it was a real
but i think that's a really an amazing creative choice that what we kind of decided to do
i obviously had to learn about all of that and to kind of explore that and to sort of teach myself as best i can what it was that will hides from the world and what he hides from the audience what we hide from the audience you don't see him really suffering
do you know what i knew amelia a little bit before we started filming a very very small amount so it was kind of nice to get to know her properly
delve deeper into a world that i wasn't that familiar with you know i hadn't met someone in a wheelchair really properly in my life
and just left a pile of papers and then she put fish in my socks
dressed the way that she was dressed it was very difficult to kind of maintain that focus and very very grumpy demeanors
decided it would be funny to kind of pretend that i kidnapped it it was a a long story but i then did kidnap it and then i stole all of her furniture out of her dressing room
yes i mean i'd like to think i was sort of aware of that prior to this story at the same time this definitely opened my eyes wider and really allowed me to kind of
like a willing and wanting kind of need desire to kind of learn more and so i watched documentaries after documentaries there's an incredible one with terry pratchett just before he passed away where he kind of followed the lives of three people going to the test
to embrace their new life but then some people can they embrace it and it can be a positive
it's it's a lot of the times i was very very surprised by how people react and and yeah it's been a real life
even when i read the script for the first time i then sort of searched what it meant i think the first time it was mentioned in the script
followed their journeys i think what what became very very clear to me is you know we're obviously telling the story of will trainor but everyone has a different story and some people really
if you know what i mean and therefore i wanted to lose a lot of muscle mass and i wanted to lose a lot of my kind of
not that i thought it would be easy but i think naively i didn't think it would be as much of a struggle as it was but honestly you know i i was pretty much tensing the entire time i was in the chair so as you can imagine for many many hours of a day that
that can be quite physically draining but i there was a lot of training involved for me through a choice of mind
injuries as well what was clear to me was when you were in that sort of state
and his decision making and kind of getting on board with that
so many people up to that point looked at him and seen the wheelchair and not the person sitting in it and i think she's not she's not afraid of telling him that he's being a nasty person when he's being a nasty person and giving as good as he gets as she gets
so i play will trainor who is a man who appears to have everything when we first meet him
