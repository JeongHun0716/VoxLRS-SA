leave take their jobs with them go next door and start polluting at will better to have them here creating the jobs in an environmentally sound responsible place where they're going to pollute last
we're consulting about that now i mean the climate leadership team did a fantastic job
community as heather scott says a community response to a community need so it's really it's and it's easy for people to get engaged at share donate some food
so many things that people can do that will make a real difference for people be a big brother or a big sister and provide some guidance in a child's life one thing that we know is that for children who struggle and who may not have a positive adult influence in their life it just takes one adult
the creation of jobs and opening up government and opening up government is all about listening to people so this is a really good example of where we can start listening to people
yeah i mean i don't know the answer to that either i think that we're going to take our lead from the community as much as we possibly can on that i know that our burritum is important to people and i know preserving that green space is important to people to the extent that we can
to be pretty frank about it because i've known joe for a long time but you know that's what he's decided to do so you know i guess i guess if he's a new democrat now that's what he is
do that i think we can enable the creation of more jobs for people and that means that more families are working and that means that they'll be giving to share rather than relying on share for support
the stress of worrying if you can make your mortgage or your rent next month the stress of wondering whether
should know and it's i liken it to a dinner table you know we're going to
we had the former chief economist of the bank of montreal come in and say
you know that's always been a part of campaigns i mean i don't know if anybody looks back at abraham lincoln's campaigns but there was a lot you know i mean so it is it's part of and i think in general we live in a less civil society i mean and my example of that is reality tv
and the people who work in film really matter and they make a big contribution but getting to a balanced budget only two provinces got to a balanced budget in the whole country that was us in saskatchewan and you don't get there without saying no to a lot of very very good causes things that in good times when the economy is not so fragile you'd have no problem supporting
this campaign we are not saying the same thing and i think that that's going to raise voter turnout
i think we all have an obligation to be a little bit more civil not just in politics
because i don't regret my time in politics at all not one bit but at the same time though i sure love the quality of life that i've got back from being in the media
you can go to the people and you can say you shouldn't be firing me
you'd find a lot of opposition to across the country because for us the thing about a car you know there are three things about the carbon
has been really supportive of that he phoned mr obama about it they've spoken he's going to raise it again when they meet at the state dinner so i'm confident that the attention is there we've just got to start getting some words on paper so that negotiation can really get going in earnest
well we had our fourth consecutive balanced budget we're the only province that's triple a rated now in canada we're eliminating our operating debt and 19% of people voted in the body
no delays they are really enthusiastic about making our lng dream in british columbia come to life
quebec which is the only other province that has a carbon tax now is at about $10 a ton and we're at $30 so that's great but there's still a gap there
was never to say and we want these conditions to be so impossible to meet that we're really saying no the company has adopted the five conditions
there are 150 coal plants 150 on the books today in china that are going to be built the only way we're going to stop the next 150 is if china gets
which is great they added one which we're totally comfortable with and most importantly for lng
well no i mean it's good for the federal government to be including a broad range
i think we can look forward to an equal future and i think that's important because one of the most interesting things for me about becoming premier has been the number of mums and particular dads who have come to me and said i'm glad we've got a woman premier
some of it really difficult to take some of it appropriate some of it inappropriate it's just the nature of the job and you know if you can't deal with that
i want people to know that on this truckers issue our primary motivation has been to fight for truckers we want to start taking control of some of these federal jobs because we think we can do a better job for truckers
our commitments i mean it's been a it's been a difficult road partly because
no pillow no blanket that's it and for him to sit there and see someone who every day spends her entire day trying to figure out how to get enough stuff to get through the next day was absolutely life changing it wasn't an easy vacation
it could have been and you know we didn't we didn't set the criteria i'm sure it was very difficult for the federal government to figure this out
a south asian representative to that board and for heaven's sakes when i had a chance to appoint somebody and i looked at the ethnic makeup of that board what a gla
trying to make sure that we can find consensus and that's really what we needed because you know the problem at the port when the federal government has been running it has been that the truckers had no one to go to no one to fix their problems no one to mediate and it was just whatever the federal port said that's what happened
they have put those criteria on their website they're fairly complex i mean one of the choices they had was to say
so things like for example whether or not the trucking reform
people depend on these jobs to support their families and they need to earn enough money to be able to build a future that's why people come to canada so i'm really committed to that the trucking community south asian community has been an incredible supporter to me many many friends in the community and i want to make sure i am a friend continue to be a friend and fight for this community
about a number of different things that we heard from the community you know really trying to be a conduit for the voice of truckers and that was one of the things that we heard but environmental
it's a luxury that many people don't have to be able to think about the future that you want to send your kids to school
we haven't really been in control of the decisions that they've been making so it's been kind of a little bit challenging for us but i think we've gone in there we fought for the truckers as well as we could as hard as we could and i think we got the truckers a pretty good deal out of the changes that the feds were making
you know the federal government put that up on the website we didn't get to design what the criteria were it was their decision now remember though they were going to make these changes
anybody who knows india will know india is a very cosmopolitan in many places very very wealthy country but it also has the largest number of poor people of any country in the world i mean 12 billion people
as hard as they possibly can and we don't want to add to their burden we want to try and take that away a little bit
homes so the home program which would give up to a $37000 no interest no payment loan to people to help them get into their first
build government homes that people will never own and then give them a subsidy to try and stay in those rental homes forever what i think people want and what they want for their kids is they want a chance for their kids
going to fix them you know when i got here that was one of those issues that was on my desk when i arrived and one of the difficult things about this year has been in particular the issues with clvc because people with developmental disabilities
know there are there are strong arguments in favor of regionalizing police forces there are lots of
certainly will be on vancouver island but is victoria airport high enough on that list in terms of generating economic activity the transport the people that work in our government and the transport ministry say it's just not
so the thing about the jobs plan is it's addressing all those areas of the economy that are most important on vancouver island
because i went and got the premier's job before i got the mla job i now have a fulltime job well a more than fulltime job so what i'm trying to do
that is a really important thing if you want to do a good job as an mla representing the community i mean it's not just about getting elected and then doing what you want which is i think you know might be what we see
the first record i ever bought was a prism record which my brother broke over his head
fingers record this morning because i was trying to refresh myself for our interview today and i was realizing i don't know any of the words to any of the songs
and my son goes to a catholic school and i say to him you know every day he says a prayer at the beginning of class and i would say sweetheart hamish i want you to pray today
again the trade needs to go in both directions so british columbians need to come here and make investments in the philippines too
another big one for us is medical technology and pharmacy
we want to go where the opportunities are for british columbia british columbia's economy is the fastest growing in canada and the philippines is one of the fastest growing economies in the world
english is the language of business is the language commonly spoken which makes it a lot easier
arm and offered me a glass of water i'd probably have said thanks
to make choices for their children and so you know if we don't have a range of choices if we don't allow independent schools or we you know and we don't we can't provide any choices for people so our public school system is excellent it is one of the best in the world and the best in the country no question about it but you know it's not perfect
the ndp numbers so of course they're going to say that and it's not true since we introduced the bc jobs plan in september 2011 we've gained 32000 jobs so that's the statistic that's the number
financial meltdown a global crisis that defied anyone's predictions and so all around the world we saw governments running up huge deficits getting themselves in deep deep trouble in british columbia we actually managed
that has allowed us to get closer to opening new mines in the province 17 new and expanded mines is our goal we're halfway there to allow us to be able to move on this liquefied natural gas opportunity we're very close to making that happen and all of the things that we've done in trade
and so i try and be straightforward even sometimes when people disagree with me but i think that's strong leadership and you know adrian dix taking all the
them and that is one of the most rewarding things that you can ever get to do
and so you know it's just politics i think but i do think you know
i'm going to give you a vote and then once you vote i'm going to respect what you say which is what i've done and so now we've gone back to the old system and i think you know there's one thing that people i hope know about me it's that when i say i'm going to do something i stick with it and i'm determined not to do it
potentially five pipelines and five liquefied natural gas plants on the coast i mean you're talking about a
so we have i mean it could be a bridge it could be another tunnel we haven't even really gotten to the stage the concept stage and nailing that part down so we're going to go and talk to
for young people but it won't just be issues with respect to affordability of housing there will be a range of measures that we will be following
that in the budget we have measures to address some of these issues that have been raised
we are all very familiar with the numerous and regular requests we get from the opposition for an independent public inquiry on every matter that comes before the legislature
to do the work that we're looking forward to doing this session as we start a new chinese new year
don't let's get rid of it and then let's do what i think all party leaders should do and i would encourage the ndp to do this as well which is ask instead for reimbursable and expenses
oh i drink my coffee with a little bit of milk and espresso
there were three people charged three people were charged and two of them were convicted
i'm the premier british columbia and i'm not the most vulnerable woman in the province and i have a platform to do it
i had to stop thinking that what had happened to me was
when we talked about that that women don't come forward to report sexual violence because they don't think it will be taken seriously
because that bill it moved me to do it and you know that when i saw the bill
they said like almost all of them had a story some of them really bad really bad stories way worse than what happened to me
it doesn't have to happen young people don't have to give up lose their lives they don't have to commit suicide because they're being bullied because we know how to stop it we just have to do more and we haven't done it yet
because what the treaty does is it sets up a framework almost a language for discussion
a similar thing happens with municipal governments each of us know what we're supposed to do and what we're responsible for funding and supporting and we have a forum then
some of the most entrepreneurial one of the most entrepreneurial first nations in the province is the niska and i would argue the achievement of their treaty was really what enabled that blossom
