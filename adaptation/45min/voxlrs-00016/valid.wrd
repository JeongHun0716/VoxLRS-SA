stepbystep development that led me in this direction i didn't i didn't i wasn't independentminded enough as a young person to go my own way and music was a path of least resistance
have been i think the best invention in opera since supertitles
clients with them and working out of their living rooms probably so that's that's really new
excited this is the first time i've seen the set it's beautiful and it's been
it's just really interesting and unique ideas i mean robert and i have worked together a lot and and it's as usual it's such a pleasure
i play her through the lens of my own experience but i'm her
it's interesting because i sang several productions when i started out and then i thought why am i singing this i can do this later so i put it away and came back to it about 10 years later and did another sort of run and then this
orchestration but also the transparency and the life and andres oh my gosh he's just brought so much joy to the whole thing the way it sounds the way it sparkles
having a blast it's a big party act one is fun act one is delightful and octavia of course she's in love she's in that sort of bloom of the experience
it's a much more lively and in a funny way it's a younger marshall in than i've been playing for a long time maybe ever
and not just tempo and not just everything else and also even with we singers when i started at the very beginning there was still
you know to have one roll under your belt twice before you're 17 is pretty neat so i don't see anything right at the moment but i think what i'll do is start concertizing more with music theater repertoire people love it i just did a rodgers and hammerstein group in in gestalt
in the prologue that's about to begin the former pirate simon bocanegra is urged to overthrow the aristocracy
you know it's funny the whole role the act ii the mute act is the hard part i mean that's really the part where i just think oh my god how am i going to hold people's attention
well that's an interesting point you know when i first sang it it was in english it wasn't known gabriela benatcheva the wonderful wonderful soprano brought it to the met first and she was my model for how to be in this part and i just we
yes and my parents also sang and they practiced and there were memorable nights when the whole neighborhood would come around the front door on a summer night and listen so it was a really heady environment in terms of
and i also really believe that people didn't sing the same way that they do now we now are filling huge halls singing in a much more athletic
i think he was a very natural singer but you know people say that about everyone
skow gave at carnegie hall again when i was a student of all of this sort of unknown repertoire of the major composers
so hard and partly because the repertoire that i sang was uncomfortable
viable way while the audience will still want this immediacy of kind of instant music
with simplicity that's coming from your heart that can very often trump
reputation is that you're impossible to get but once you have committed to something you are there i said that's not so bad
suspect that there's a surprisingly large percentage of operas which are cast around the world now off of youtube
in a major voice in a sort of worldclass instrument particularly in verdi puccini and wagner absolutely
the tendency interestingly enough physically when you're singing and when you're learning
so but if you don't have that sense of getting to the heart of what it is you're saying
it is a bonanza as you said for just discovery and you can sit there for hours just following the trail of some obscure wonderful performance
so much courage and and and she's quite and she's clever
really challenging i mean in fact when i first read for the play it was sort of you know for the experience i thought oh i'll do this reading you know but if i said them but of course you realize i can't i can't do it i can't do the play because you know we're i'm too booked up
on the other hand one has to i think consider the time and the kind of the difference between the two of them
recording in a tiny little dry booth was a bit of a shock so vocally it's natural i'm singing where i speak
exactly well in some ways it's stressful of course because i feel a tremendous responsibility to those people that in the case of 911 that i'm trying to give comfort to in the case of the inauguration
permission to be who they are and to find their own unique path
and i've since gone over another time and spent three glorious hours with her and after about five minutes i realized that what she was saying was so important and i didn't want to forget anything so i said ms price could i please take notes and seven pages later i would come home and transcribe these notes because i just thought i don't ever want to forget what she said
when i got to meet him actually after the audition and the happy news was that they said you know we really don't have a place
completely shattered with the smallminded behavior of the three men and of course this is based susanna and the elders is a story in which many many great paintings in history are based so it's a theme that we've seen before
and we performed recently a new song cycle which was written for me this past season by henri dutier
her voice in such pristine shape over a long period of time what a great woman great life
one of the other things i really admire about james levine is his commitment to new music and to music which is not always embraced by the public at large but which inspires him
get anywhere and of course i don't really know why but the rest is history and i did eventually find my way
it depends on the genre in a recital program with piano it's an equal partnership i want the audience to be distracted constantly from what i'm doing because the piano playing is on such a high level and so music
19th century and the 18th century so i from that i believe that the technique of singing was far different than it is today
yeah because it's sort of leaked it's on the internet but actor austrian actor christoph wald
because there were throngs surrounding the car so exciting
peruvian composer trained in helsinki which is one of the great composition schools great orchestrator a real
besides josh we have alison krauss me and eric owens are classical sutton foster and norm lewis are broadway i don't even know if any of these names
well i mean the scheduling thing for me has always been the biggest challenge also because i have two children so trying to figure out how to
as much as i'm known for it and as much as i've done it i've only sung revivals
it's easy to explain you know i can describe in five minutes how to sing but doing it
hip length white charmeuse negligee running around beautiful beautiful soprano and running running running running and then she had to sing the song of the moon
one to the other i mean there's a reason that thomas jefferson and einstein played the violin and they played the violin so they could kind of
to low in terms of range and dynamic range it's also absolutely every extreme
it's exhausting emotionally as well it's not just the drama of the singing although if you really want to invest the right amount of emotion in this part it is
in some ways more reliable but the four or five year i'm really in my prime right now
yeah incredible and an incredible person and certainly james levine who's here leading my home
but i don't speak the language so i'm kind of singing by rote the sounds and i know what they mean of course but it was
i'm glad i put it away several early
i'm really grappling with this issue what in life is important
what should my priorities be right now am i giving my children enough time
