people call it you know a zeitgeist but a zeitgeist is just for a short period of time i always think that was a moment and this is more than a moment this has been 14 years and it keeps evolving and i think part of the reason is is because it took so long to get
it's a double edged sword in some ways because you think i'd like to play other parts people want you to be samantha because they love samantha so much but there's i've been very fortunate especially in the last year to try and change that and take other roles and challenges but i will always love samantha and be grateful that she's been in my life because i could never i wouldn't be here sitting
it changed my life irrevocably being part of it i mean i'm i'm known throughout the world i'm known you see samantha's known i'm not known they but the
because they want to see their lives and they want to laugh at it and they want to be touched by it and that's what i think this show continues
but i wanted some kind of accentuation so we decided to have this terrific designer do these fingernails so i loved coordinating my fingernail polish or my fingernail attaches to whatever outwit outfit that i was changed into it was just an added little
very honest true way and that's why it's around it grows anything in nature if it
i was amazing i never felt in any kind of jeopardy i never felt frightened they were always there and if there was any pictures taken they were they were destroyed
i think that the way it's written for men and women and the way they interchange and and connect or don't connect is very truthfully written
the first time to sort of get the plot lines and enjoy it but then the second time you see it you think oh i forgot that costume or oh i forgot that scape in the background or it's just a real visual delight as well as fun
for seven weeks i don't think i have ever felt so far away from home a completely different culture especially if you're
for me because you know i consider it my work and i know when they say cut
except to prove maybe something to myself and maybe what that was is that i still loved it and i still needed to do it and that's exactly what
and i just didn't feel that i was up to it i didn't think i could pull the sexy gal
and it was because i was so young they all said well you're very talented but we don't take anybody younger than 18 or 21 in england so i just the the american academy said if you pass the exam and you have a high school graduation which i had i could i could go to the school
and i've realized that the way my life has always been and what i'm trying to embrace at this point in my life is that where i am is where i live so when i'm in new york i do feel like a new yorker when i'm in london i do feel like a brit and when i'm in canada i'm a cana
it's very clear but when i i can tell when people meet me for the first time that images are going through their head
part anymore i felt you know that's kind of and that was in 1997 and that doesn't seem like a terribly long time ago not to me
and knowing yourself knowing having been in so many situations in so many
understanding that you can still keep learning and changing and grow
level that is happening but it was such a supportive atmosphere it was in sometimes a scary place because we were going and and taking on subject matter that had never been seen especially on tele
similar ways you say ah that's what i think that's where i go sometimes it's a cautionary tale because we can all do with reflection from others and ourselves but also in a way of understanding and a personality a part of you which is already established and honoring that saying you know i don't do well in that kind of circumstance
bring an audience that brings us further as women it brings us further as as human beings really i mean we need to understand not just each other in a in a gender way we need to understand
a woman you know a questioning part of her a romantic side of her a very sort of ambitious male side to her and a kind of a fun adventurous side to her and all of those moods were
those characters but we never knew it was going to capture a moment in people's imagination
no one had really seen a character like her before she was sort of like a modern day aphrodite
oh we did not to the extent but there was paparazzi and there were a lot of people in marrakesh who know the show quite well and enjoy it they kept calling me samantha so i knew something was up
but that's why i think that we eventually came to morocco because i think it's much more liberal and much more open than other arab nations and they they love samantha they love the show they got the show they understood what we were doing most of our extras had never been extras before and they were sort of fascinated but completely bored by it after a while
on and off camera there's we've grown up together this has been
fantastic it was like going back in time when the series you know was four single girls
which was a little unsettling you know and also exciting because everything was new and different
yes in some ways we are definitely and sometimes we do
smart and ambitious and brilliant in our own way and compete with men as as a woman and i feel that sex and the city has really given four prototypes for women that make up one complete woman and that's why it's so easy to relate to what's going on for any given character
here's about 25 i'm bored with 25 it's like a young wine i hate beaujolais i don't want to drink it i think it tastes terrible i want a nice full body
no it's a great great honor to get this award and i am the fact that it has distinction the word and and the the
kind of relaxed attitude to work of really collaborating is what i think makes sex and the city so so
oh you're getting some kind of an award i think oh god my bad old i mean
