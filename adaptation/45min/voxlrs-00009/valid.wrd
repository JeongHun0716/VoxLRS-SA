one of my favorite people on this planet and it just was very fortuitous that i was presenting and happened to be on the side of the stage and couldn't get back to my seat in time when she was there so i was just grateful to be able to celebrate in that moment with her i'm incredibly happy for her
exactly yeah and we were shooting we would get ready we'd wake up before the sun came up we'd start shooting when the sun came up and then once the sun went down we were done shooting for the day so you're like back in the natural rhythm of nature which you just don't normally get to be in now in this day and age
on the front and it's all about the just iconic trailblazing women who did the same job that weaver did and all of the little eccentricities of it and how they put their life on the line it's really really fascinating
and so it was fun to just like imagine what that would be like and actually be kind of in the jungle in those situations
it was a really great day for me actually because generally my days consisted of running and jumping and climbing and that day i just got to sleep on a little pad so i loved it
oh i suppose i don't really think i knew what to expect i've never done a film of this size before so every day was sort of like magical and
and wondered if studio movies were a place that i could go to have a film like this is of this size and of a spectacle like this
producers would be there and we'd have some lego and lego would be there and we could play with that and sort of have bits of conversation but then talk with other people if there wasn't
like this occur your brain is just wanting to survive so it really can't look at the trauma specifically it has to shut it off until you're in a place that's safe and then the brain can sort of bring
shooting in order was kind of vital in that way that if we're doing a scene where you're going through the day and we're brushing our teeth and then we pick out we got to pick out our clothes on camera as to what we wanted to wear in the next scene
and so when the movie starts you're seeing a completely different person i mean you're seeing somebody who's been in a space with no sunlight very little nutrition no chance to be outside
i always saw it as like what's on the page like it's a mom giving up her son
you know run for your life and so that was kind of a huge part of my performance just fighting against those clothes
but he had these um these little star wars figurines and so when i was able to talk with him a little bit about that and that he was able to go okay so you know about that and you know we got to talk about
i think that those that love the book really enjoy watching the movie unfold but there's been quite a few people that i've spoken with that went in completely blind and it's like a completely
the ground so it was really awesome to be part of a film that kind of put this out for everybody to see
i think that how that sort of worked was that each of us had very specific characters that we came to the table with and making any movie is kind of like alchemy and you're putting all of these actors together and then you're watching
i think i'm still trying to figure that out i don't it's a very surreal experience that no one prepares you for and no one can prepare you for and your brain doesn't really know how to process it directly after the oscars i flew on a plane and was back in vietnam filming this movie so i was kind of just in the middle of nowhere contemplating my existence
i am such a huge fan of his work i think that he's absolutely brilliant it was a pleasure to work with him i want to do so many movies with him i think he's the best
him what an incredible actor he was and to keep going he just refused every time i would try and be like so jacob he'd be like nah i'm not saying goodbye to you i don't need to say goodbye i'm going to see you again i'm going to see you and he did that all day until the very end of the day where i finally was like i really need you to say goodbye to me and he tackled me to the ground
because it's really an it's a powerful moment to experience and i don't know how many people in the world have experienced this but when i got to like touch an elephant
willing to understand him and not use force i mean she's the only character that doesn't have a weapon
it asks some really great questions of us of what's important to us what are we willing to risk our life for how do we want to handle the untouched land on our planet how do we want to protect the vulnerable
for me what was so powerful about it was that here is this creature that could very easily
secluded parts to try and get the feel of what it's like to be in land that's been untouched by man so because of that like a lot of the time there's no cell service there's certainly not wifi it was too far away to go back to your trailer between setups
this push and pull where i get close to it and then i take a step back and i was sort of laughing and crying and
i didn't really think about it the precious stuff i don't think so much about when i'm making it
i don't know what i said at all i hope i thanked people
and then when he came up he's a very light whimsical person
start off in situations that are very simple and sort of dark in some ways but that's you need that darkness to propel them outwards into the world and into the complexity of life
stay away from looking at it but even just taking an hour in the morning
the whole thing i mean generally just the whole thing i'm not so i mean i think this movie beautifully depicts not only romance but just like sex and i read so many scripts that the entire plot point is about someone losing
by how moved so many people were and how deeply the story resonated with them
it's just they become hyper aware that you're there so within that when all of these egos are kind of getting inflamed and bouncing around she's trying to keep everything calm which is just kind of impossible
pretty much yeah i mean we shot pretty much in order so at first we were clean and then as time went on we slowly got dirtier and dirtier and then by the end of it it was part of getting ready for the day was
oh what's this crazy movie where there's this giant thing attacking these other tiny people you're just it's just like oh it's kong
it's part of our language i feel like it's like next to the question mark it's just a symbol it's a symbol that we know
when weaver is taking photos and she's a photojournalist it's all of those same shenanigans plus being a woman at that period of time when that was very difficult in a man's world and no light meter on her camera focusing a camera and running from things generally
other films you can kind of make character choices based upon the weather where you're like it's a hot day so i'm not gonna wear this jacket thanks wardrobe
think he thought for the longest time his only true love they met in college and she was a redheaded very quiet sweet girl and didn't go out very much was kind of a nerd and they started a band together called kid chameleon
aligned staff at a shortterm foster care facility so i'm kind of the person who deals with their daytoday so this is the movie deals a lot with the daytoday and this is part of the highs and lows
to eat a steak at the same time like scalloped potatoes doesn't work in the shower it doesn't taste good with water
i did a film with michael chapman when i was 15 he's an absolutely legendary dp
i just don't have any more to give and you realize that there's more and that life keeps going and that it is hard but that's okay and the movie continued to just reflect
scared me and i felt something that my mother had talked to me about so many times when she would get worried about me and i go why do you worry so much and she say because i love you so much you have no idea what this feels like and i kept getting these intense tastes of it
scared me it's the most wonderful incredible feeling in the world and it's also the most terrifying
and her husband has a son from a previous marriage named alistair
really cramped in there so our director lenny he would hide in the bathtub he would lay
the struggle for grace through much of the film is her not wanting to recognize things within herself and wanting to continue to throw herself into saving
all regulated it's not a jail it's not a prison so there isn't an actual locked gate and so if if any of the the youth are smart enough and a lot of them are
the thing that i've always had a hard time with is the formality of acting
thank you first to the academy i want to start big
i mean those are behind the scenes mysteries that i just simply cannot say
i'm wanting to put a lot into that interview scene that's at the end of the movie because i wanted to expose
pores i didn't wash my face for a long time to just get it all gross and at first you're sort of like oh god and then you adjust to it and then by the time she's got makeup on you're like why does anyone put makeup on
interesting to play or to be the above kind of puppet master to somebody
you know hiding behind a wall and it meant a week of just laying which was really really nice but then you'd have another week where you have to try and crawl over this huge warehouse and i got bruised pretty badly because there's lots of rocks and things on the ground
so anyway i said you have such a good sense of humor i'm so glad you're so ok with all of this and he was like yeah i was going to say the same thing about you
i think is what you're supposed to do when you are a bachelor but he did kind of give us some fun behind the scenes stuff of like talking about like what was happening when they were in the woods it was that episode where they were like doing the tarot card reading
kind of tough on the bingo card one of them is chris harrison appears it is like it's very that's a stressful one
so i guess the party's become sort of infamous at this point okay and a friend of a friend kind of found out about it and so he showed up at one of our gatherings a couple weeks ago
you're with me on that i thought it was gonna be danielle until the end and i really am upset that she let me down
i've never been part of a film that has had this kind of reception before so
i had become friends with claire of grimes and she was like i'm having a birthday party it's a costume party and i showed up as daisy from nintendo princess daisy
and been the only one in a costume this i felt fine with
just doing of the my very first scene with her and getting to like
i know how they shot that or i can see the reflection of the camera in that window or i wonder how many times how many takes it took them to do that or you just start to understand so much of the logistics of making a movie that sometimes the illusion is broken
i've spent probably a hundred times more time talking about it than we did making it or even talking before we made the movie
complicated but is also still a good person and is struggling with herself
one thing i tried for a while was eating dinner in the shower i was adamant that that was going to be a great time saver
and jake going off and trying to find himself which means for him kind of digging and finding weird bones in the backyard and for her
so they're thinking about identity and what it means to be together and what it means to maybe be separate and who they were before who they might want to be in the future and they kind of take a
but it's a great thing for so long we've loved women because they're beautiful and now we're seeing that you can be beautiful and there's a mind behind it and we're giving
although i didn't have kong there i still had these beautiful locations in this
