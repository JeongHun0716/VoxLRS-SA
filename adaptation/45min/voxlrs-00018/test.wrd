it comes from generally learning i guess about the foundation of this country
that that truly are different than anything else the world has ever seen and we need to understand that that is what has made our country what it is right now and if we move away from that we are going to make the same mistakes that many other countries have
that is where we are going to move away from that foundation and that basis and we'll have no consistency and anybody knows that that there chaos occurs when there is no consistency in government and when people cannot trust the government because they don't even obey the laws and i think that's something that everybody needs to really focus on is understanding that we have to do the right thing we have
absolutely whatever the labels may be absolutely i do think that all of us should be much more focused on that because whether you agree with the things in the constitution or not everybody needs to realize that we all have to obey the law
agree with something that's in the constitution we need to go about amending it but you have to do it the right way you have to follow the proper steps we can't just say well i don't like that law so i'm not going to listen to it you know we have to focus on on no one is above those
but really a lot of things about myself i've learned that i can stretch my limits beyond what i ever imagined
year of course and seeing my face on the big posters and on the marquee in front and all of these things
do in the country this year especially with the focus on obesity as well as eating disorders as well as health issues in general
community service find ways to volunteer find ways to reach out and lend a help
of a balanced healthy diet in moderation living a healthy lifestyle and that's what i've been trying to
that are doing amazing things and you realize all the good that is happening in the country and you start to let go of that sense of hopelessness and despotency
into an even broader campaign to focus generally on health nutrition wellbeing
so my dad made it very clear very quickly that scholarships were going to be the way to do that so
possible i've learned a lot about society and the country as a whole as well my patriotism has certainly grown stronger because as i've traveled this country i've found so many incredible
when you do that you will find how much power you have inside of you to make
right well it's a very strange feeling because i remember walking in last year
service and volunteering i found tremendous confidence and self esteem in that
last year i spent my 18th birthday at the super bowl and so i was trying to figure out what i
fitness special skills and an adventurous journey it's an incredible award and then
grad first which will be next year so there's a lot of years of school ahead but in the future we'll see how everything goes
all all about this award which really does do the same things that the miss america organization really focuses on with survey
actually after i'm done with my years miss america i'm no longer allowed to wear it only the current reigning miss america
days with his royal highness prince edward because the duke of edinburgh award has
your creativity out you know and that's what's so fun about it is i encourage anybody to find those things that they love to do and make things out of it
and now new york with events with the prince it's been absolutely fantastic we had many different events in baltimore with
having the experience that i need for it right now and i want to all the more now
was that i needed to focus on what was best for me and then not worry about the rest and so that's really what i try to help especially young women realize that to be success
the weight it's not about the numbers it really is about leading a healthy lifestyle and making those healthy choices because that's going to make the biggest difference in the long run
youth service america and so today we're headed over to queens working with a group of students who are going to teach me an authentic filipino dance as well as they're going to be making some healthy filipino food we're really focusing on hitting child obesity
to be accomplished and to even win miss america you don't have to do those things that so many people are telling you to do
right i think that so many times especially young people just don't see that enough they're not involved in it they don't understand they go to the store and food's always there but why is it there we have to understand why it's so important that we do continue to support agriculture and farming
talking about getting active eating healthy food and we're gonna have a fun time today
without ever having to hurt yourself or look down on yourself for the way you look without trying to be something you're not it's about being the best version of yourself you can be being the very best that you were made to be not trying to look like the per
a another project that we've been working on is really focusing on agriculture and farming working with the hand that feeds us and talking about where it is that our food comes from why agriculture and farming is so important why that is the heart and soul of this country and coming from
looking down upon us way and so that really helped a lot because i felt like i was learning from them and not being intimidated by them but just being lifted up and encouraged during the week and so you know with with an age discrepancy you have to make up for it with experience intelligence or maturity
no 17 year old had won right because it's kind of hard to be 17 and graduated from high school and still qualify for your local and your state definitely so the timing worked out perfectly with me it it was about two weeks there that i had to compete but it worked out but no other 17 year old has won since 1937 although in the beginning of the competition there were very very young girls
well honestly i don't know how it was in years past but this year i really felt that the whole group of girls were extremely supportive and encouraging of each other and that helped a lot because even though i was in the younger group we were like little sisters
i would wear it for any part of the competition but we opted out of that one
glad i had that experience and kind of had a taste of both because i think that really helped in the long run definitely helping me understand different kinds of people and all sorts of
and they do well through the middle so it was fun but i'm close with my siblings and we always had a crazy
i'm the middle so i've got three older and three younger and so it was always interesting i think it's a good spot to be though when your parents have kind of learned through the
year long when we're we're traveling all over the country and the world as well we will be wearing everything by joseph ribcov it's really great that they sponsor us this year it takes care of a lot of
about exposing their style their company to the world and so it's really neat to be able to do that for
representative for them their fashion correspondent so representing joseph ribcov is really incredible for me representing younger women also which their company does a great job of appealing to all ages and women and so it's really neat to showcase that as well
