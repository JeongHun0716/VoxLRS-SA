we are in in some of our the new housing that we're building the 5000 new units some of them will be for you know for a larger family because that
there are 25 other people sitting with them waiting to build on the to bid on the same suite
they get it if there are this many units that are available for families that's a really important part of this process
one of the things that we can do is when we build rapid transit as we are going to in surrey and in vancouver is insist that at every transit station it be
important i mean it's so hard if you've got more than one child to try and find a place to live
can find affordable housing so that's a key part but remember you know really what has to happen is cities can zone this they can say you know you're i'm going to give you a permit jeremy you're you've got a you know a
once that bidding is over it's going to be really expensive for whoever gets it if there are more places to bid on
that's what i'd like to see is way more supply out there so that when you're in there trying to buy a condo maybe there's only one other person that wants to buy it because there are so many new condos that are available now for people to go after
give you a good example jeremy if you are i'm sure you know people like this because i do too
we have to keep our foot on the gas with education so it means we've got to make sure we're continuing to make that investment in people so that the people of this province are first in line for the jobs because you know
that most of the jobs will go to british well that all of the jobs will go to british columbians first then we'll go and look across the country invite other canadians to come because we simply don't have enough people here to fill all the jobs
and you know that seems to me to be a pretty reasonable tradeoff to secure a 36 billion dollars investment
there's little bumps in the road sometimes but it's been very positive you think 55 agreements 28 first nations that's a pretty good number we've got a few first nations with whom we're still working but they've all said they want this to happen and so when you're
these remote first nations communities to create their own economies and we all know that first nations in parts of this province have suffered for a long time i want to see them you know people in those in those communities going to work and getting an education and make sure their kids have the same chance as everybody else
all of those induced and indirect jobs are counted in that and they matter i mean those are
in the 1990s and that's why we had the devastation that we had all through the 2000s so as a government we devoted over 800 million dollars to battling them
which john rustad so ably chaired which gave us a good start in thinking about
i mean the other thing you know mr dixon didn't even mention
would have would forget to think of a talk about the pine beetle devastation when you were in prince george
we are going to have it costed and we are not going to do it on the backs of the people who work in the forest industry we are going to find a way to do it and it absolutely needs to be done and that was
you can expect more news about where we are going to take forest innovative for forest revitalization
conditions we are being and by the way we're be i think being quite principled being
through the transition process people will want to know exactly what the rules are going to be and how it's going to work it's going to essentially be the same as the old system and so i think people who have been established for a while will understand you know will have a good feel for how that could work i think it's going to be extra challenging though for people who have incorporated
one of the things that we're talking about is matching the federal income tax benefit working working tax benefit so it's for people who are the working poor to give them a leg up and it just it just adds straight to their bottom line part of it is intended to make it a better deal to work than to be on social
candidate in this race who isn't getting paid every two weeks by taxpayers in order to be a leadership candidate i mean i'm i'm i'm living off my savings while i'm doing this and i'm the only candidate who on the 27th if i lose will stop will still not be getting a cheque from taxpayers every two weeks so i don't know i mean i have to think about how i'm going to put food on the table for haymish
four years in government trying to clean up after those guys i spent some time in the private sector i mean i i haven't been on a track where i've i've spent it every day thinking gosh how can i be premier one day in fact if this if if gordon campbell hadn't have resigned i would have been quite happy to stay in broadcasting for many many more years
well i was deputy premier minister of education i was vice chair of treasury board i had all those three roles when the amish was just
your child is an infant they're consuming more of your time than in any other time in their lives i share custody of my son too so it's not as though i have him with me 24 7 as much as i would love to right but so it it's not as onerous as it was when he was little i'm not underestimating the fact that it's going to be hard though i know that it is and hamish knows
more important to british columbia than anywhere else and good on him he got it done he got it on the agenda
50 million people so maybe not quite that many but maybe 10
so pres president comes up in in a 100 days to canada for his state dinner
lot of us all of us we would go surely would go and talk to our federal counterparts and we would be all softwood all the time got it on the agenda and then you know
written down and so i mean i don't think we could have hoped for better out of the federal government on this they did a really good job and now it's up to us to work with them to make sure bc's interests are protected the negotiation will be lumpy and bumpy we know that it always is and
growing the market in india we think that's the next china and we're also investing in secondary cities i mean you know we call them
and we our assumption is they intend to have it solved by the time it comes up and that's great and the thing is about softwood a hundred days a hundred days
yes we have we so for the first thing i ever said to him when he became prime minister was we need you to help us settle ourself with lumber deal because we know it only gets settled by prime minister or president talking
yes and but we will we will get to a place where i'm sure you know it's not really satisfactory for either side but it's better than unmanaged trade and
