not with queensland nickel i mean first of all let me just say that all these reports just say that we took money out of the company is just not true not one dollar ever went to me personally of queensland nickel's money
i've had $12 billion of investment in western australia employed 60000 people in the country what have they done really other than run fates and wrestles
there's been no courage about that but those families are just as important and the federal government needs to
no because everyone said that we couldn't win a house of reps seat in a six weeks campaign
and when i asked malcolm what he was doing at that time he said i'm making announcements mainly i've been here since i've been prime minister making announcements well we need a prime minister that actually does something politics is not just about making announcements and what i said today
as i said the truth is that i don't control the world nickel price but it's not about me who cares what happens to clive palmer hopefully my wife does and my kids do but who cares about politicians really it's what they can do for the country what they stand for how much time do we spend having a go at individuals rather than saying what are you going to do for the country that's the most important thing
than serving your own pocket so if people want to come to parliament they should come to do what good they can do and not leave with any entitlements at all
lazarus right he got about 6000 votes in queensland and 225000 votes from the party jackie lambie in tasmania got 800 and 22000 from the palmer united party so you know they don't have any political organisation they don't have any resources so it will be very hard for them but it's not a good
sydney and i'd spoken to ewan jones on the phone i said there was a $10 million gap in the cash flow and i said if the commonwealth covered that for three weeks everyone could keep employed and none of that would have happened and of course the member for herbert told me to get lost and the prime minister said he would see what he could do
i've donated all my salary anyway but i don't think we want people that will serve the community that's the most important
we will stop the 2014 budget and we will make sure that politicians
well i think that was at a time when we were just having the balance of power in australia
well i don't agree with it but neither does the federal court justice dowsett of the federal court two weeks ago gave an order restricting the liquidator of the refinery from making any decisions or making any decisions
gave a speech on gender equality which was adopted by the government in march so we'll now see on all commonwealth bodies a minimum of 40% of each gender so he's certainly a response
well that's not true she was preferenced 25th i think on our ticket she wasn't preferenced 1 2 3 or 4
and we won three senators as you know and i was successful in the house of representatives that sort of result hasn't happened since federation
no not really but certainly he's been responsive to some of our initiatives we've certainly suggested in parliament that we should have the chapter 11 and he's indicated the government will go ahead with that for insolvency
guarantee they won't be of course the 20 million dollar donation was back in 2013 and the company was completely solvent we had a bumpy year i owed the company 100 percent there was no debt there were no debt shareholders this is a free country
we also guarantee 10% reduction of electricity prices throughout australia the mining tax has been repealed
into trouble with the prime minister's chief of staff because i used her as an example of her income i didn't attack her personally i think it's wrong to say that my mistakes are i'm sure that the prime minister wouldn't say that about
didn't have the support of the community and we thought there wasn't an emphasis on how we make this economy go how we reestablish confidence and how we create more wealth
been achieved everyone whinges about the budget
to do something which will be good for the country he doesn't want to squander that chance or there won't be any more chances for him
well i think it's pretty clear what it covers there's a definition of an electricity producer and a natural gas producer it covers anyone that generates or deals with that commodity it doesn't cover anyone else
that time i had people as high as the vice presidency and of others that had no idea about the party's finances
for your prime minister is not that good really there's 100% of australians that need to be served and we need to see the right policies so far the government's been lying to the australian people
we don't have a problem in relation to our level of debt at all if we still kept going the way we were in 50 years time our debt would be less than the united states today
that's my name does that look like i'm trying to hide anything of course i'm not just let me say one thing if i can anna we didn't want anyone not to get their entitlements that wasn't our decision that was the decision of the administrators not us and i obtained $23 million on 10 march to keep the refinery going and the administrators refused to hand the joint venture
it's the responsibility under the joint venture agreement to monitor their expenditure
of course not that email if i wanted to make an appointment at the wild duck restaurant
which was instituted by queensland nickel when it was owned by the queensland government now queensland nickel when it acts in its own behalf which it rarely ever does doing its annual accounts and things like that have got no role in relation to the running of the joint venture
that worked for us i think all that was pretty good and the fact that we paid our staff 25% above award i think all that was good i think it was good when you look at the australian when it says i was the boss of the year on their front page back in 2000
of the business of which i am a member of the joint venture committee which tells the manager what he can and can't do on their behalf which is set out in a
when i was told by the director i think the accounts were signed by the auditor in september 2015
the government is 23 years of growth at one of the lowest debt levels in the oecd the treasurer tells everybody we've got a serious debt problem which is just a fantasy
along like me and offers us a million dollars that's the result you get whether it's in the interest of the public or not
to five members of parliament stater are being accessed are any crossbench members including me having their phones and their emails tapped or intercepted by any commonwealth or state agency or any foreign government doing this to give the government plausible denial are our parliamentary officers bargaining
they police it out and they say gee haven't we done a good job reelect us it doesn't matter who's in power liberal or labor this seems to be how politics works but it's not about
yeah sure we want to the most important thing here is not clive palmer the most important is keeping the industry going for queensland and australia
well that's not true that's just absolutely not true all those things you're talking about go back to 2013 and 2014 when the company made bumper profits and the nickel price was quite high
that as an investor putting all this aside i don't think i'm prepared to put millions of dollars in there unless this clears
well that was not in cash that was just in using offices and things like that
first of all cathy if it's ok i'd like to just issue a quick apology i'd just like to apologise to all those people that have gone to unitedaustraliaorg and tried to log on to join the party because they've blown up the website that's how we're going
well we don't publish our party membership numbers either do the labor party or the liberal party but we'll be applying to the aec next week and we've got a sufficient number of people to do that and that's the most important thing
and you'll find that we will in the coming weeks no doubt have members of parliament joining us and we'll be a registered party here in queensland so these people have no claim whatsoever to that name
now every other country in the world has a policy to let people get on the plane without a visa
the national party to have all these bogus parties or committees to confuse the media it's a very good tactic and they've probably taken it out of one of the books that i've written for them but actually we hold the business name for the united australia party you know something we also hold the business name for the name they're trying to register unifying australia
you can't have people that have never run a tuck shop run a 15 trillion dollar economy and all this policy discussion is a waste of time i've been there i know how it works no one listens to what they say on the press they're only worried about their perception i'm worried about reality
liberals are labor we shouldn't really say they're bad people we should want to get the best for the community i think we need to take away the gain from professional politicians who say the same thing it doesn't matter whether it's tony abbott or julia gillard they've got the same lobbyists in fletum the same focus groups we need to think about more what the people need
tony maybe you haven't realised that but i think i'm in fighting fit at the moment
i'm just a party member like everyone else and i've got to go along with the rules otherwise it would be wrong for me to presume i'd get endorsed anyway
the fifth one of course is we do think that australia needs to have a system where people who create wealth in various parts of the country that some of it goes back to that part of the country sort of that if a region is creating a certain amount of wealth they can be sure that that will flow back into their community so we really developed the whole country not just sydney and melbourne but right across australia because that's where the wealth comes from
he's been spying on rupert for years giving money back to chinese intelligence read the truth about it
lodge their tax returns yearly in arrears when they've actually made the money that will release $70 billion in the australian economy and each time it circulates the government will get $7 billion of tax on gst so if it goes around five or six times they'll get another $35 billion that means we'll have decent hospitals a rising standard of living and we'll be able to increase our pensions for our pensioners what's wrong with that
at three billion dollars a week what about australia and what the anzac's fought for we'll be up there and we've got candidates at 150 seats across this nation ready to take government if that's what the australian people want that we respect that rupert murdoch doesn't that president obama's immediate advisers advising rudd don't this is about australia
i'm not very confident at all carl we're looking for about 10 senate seats across australia that's what our polls are telling us you're just reading the rubbish that rupert murdoch puts out with the eoghan's news poll the eoghan's galaxy poll and he said he's going to support tony abbott as prime minister he's sworn an oath of allegiance to a foreign country he's not an australian citizen
who now have to lodge their tax returns quarterly in advance
talk about the people in the hunter valley that can't survive in new south wales
and we're taking immediate action in the supreme court to take it out that i'll be commencing proceedings against the lawyers that have said it that have breached their oath of honesty to the court
for me anyway i'm happy to make a contribution the best i can the whole point about democracy is about people having ideas and debate and things like that it's not about positions
minister for resources and the south african minister for resources and the brazilian minister for resources because again australia will be able to attract investment jobs and exports
well first of all don't worry about failing because we all fail at different times i've failed more than anyone else why we fail is maybe because the market wasn't right we didn't have enough money
we want a transparent system in australia because if you've got governments be they labor liberal or anyone else you don't want
