issue that had not been addressed and you know there had not been a regional discussion if we if we look at labor peace i mean you know we've been talking about
and influence policies that will make the world safer for people that is one of the things that is core to my reason for being in politics
my take is that it's unfortunate that there was a rejection of the national aboriginal organization's call before that call had even
the most important issue and the one that we kept coming back to was creation of jobs and the economy and there were a couple of issues that we discussed under that rubric and the
provisions were adequate and that they were in place and it broadened to a discussion about marine salvage you know it's again we're sitting around the table with people from all parts of the country and so making sure that that the movement of goods the movement of dangerous materials and the the reaction
of the governance of metrolinx i think that what we need to make sure is that when a plan is put in place that that plan gets implemented
a woman premier in alberta i'm there as a woman
well i'm not going to presume to give advice to the us i think i can give advice to ourselves just to go back to your first comment about the wild rose if you follow the social media that happened after that incident in alberta there was a homophobic
for just a change in that talent not a devaluing of some and a valuing over of others but just making sure that we've got everybody being able to bring their voice to the table
we have to recognize that you have to look at the numbers you have to look at the experience you have to look at the regions and i will do my best to have representation from around the province experience
talking to me about not being able to get to the table where the decisions were being made on their campuses about sexual violence sexual harassment policies not being part of the conversation and i just i had to be held into my seat because i'm 63 we were having that conversation 45 years ago enough
our concern with the afrocentric school was that we really believe that kids from all races and backgrounds should be together i really believe that in ontario which is one of the most diverse schools in the world
we still believe that there's room to grow that's why we set the 75% target and it's a work in progress i'm going to be meeting in the next few weeks with folks from around the world who are looking at their own living
spring or in the winter time they go to performances they go watch kids play play different sports they take part in activities at the school
begin those conversations because they're difficult and you know if a if a fouryearold or a fiveyearold comes to school and that child lives in a lesbian or
off in 20 years spread it over a 30 year period as you would a mortgage
in one at a time the tolling decision was about affordability for people it absolutely was there had not been a regional discussion
have been about trying to help people to deal with costs you know the investments that we've made in electricity the fact that we have a reliable clean
they for whatever reason are not on the same page as maybe the others of us you know that there are divisions that we haven't acknowledged and so i think if anything
to change the working world and create jobs as well i think that we need to celebrate that in ontario we need to celebrate 50 years of that relationship between the working world and the labour market and these terrific institutions that have evolved over the last 50 years
and that versatility it was terrific so there's a lot going on at humber
decision that we would reorient the system and put that money into grants for low income so really it was working with
learn from that but i'm not giving up on the values that i've been fighting for since i was 15 years old you know when i was growing up in the
everybody in the community is involved in something i've been to the farmers market i was here for the walk a mile in hershey
so we celebrate the two at the same time my heritage my irish heritage it's very important to me that we recognize
so i will follow their lead but just to actually merge your last question
that that's a great shame i would like to see for example i'd like to see people understand better what world religions are and how do we separate religion
for example and we've done various things across government to recognize diversity but it seems to me that recently because of some issues like carding for example
celebrations it's just a wonderful celebration of spring and we always joke because it comes very close to st patrick's day
well you know what we can have that semantic discussion
again those students will not receive less support than they receive now so the middle income
but just to go back to the beginning it would have been irresponsible if we had not made the investments in the electricity system that we've made
run right exactly and our target then is to continue to manage the
is that not everybody in the province who is actually eligible has applied and so i've talked to the head of the ontario energy board and i've said you know what we've got to do better about reaching people
stopped and we have not you know because i really believe there has to be a balance we have not taken all of those tools away from police officers they do
zoning of the municipality and so what they can do then is bump the refusal
let's put the decision making at the local level and make counselors and
and it's exactly why you know distribution companies need to make sure that people who are living on low income and who are that strapped get that access it is the ontario energy support program is a program that people need to apply to
part of the province and recognized that they didn't have the kids here didn't have access to postsecondary education in a way that other
we're doing that in order to build new assets for your children so this is an asset that the people of ontario have owned for a very long time
i you know for some time now we have been working to take costs out of the system so we renegotiated agreements like the samsung agreement which is actually taking billions of dollars out of the system we made a decision not to build new nuclear michael because that was
i mean this was a decision at the local level i'm not going to pretend michael that i wasn't disappointed because i was i was disappointed i would have liked to see this plan go forward
in terms of it's a huge number michael and you and i it's really hard to it's hard to imagine those numbers yes but we made a
set up with the doctors that were agreed upon both by the government and the doctors doctors occupy a sort of unique place in
here's my greatest concern and i can speak as the mpp for that particular community but also as the premier my biggest concern about the way that issue was dealt with is that there were rifts that were created in the community
the proposals that were on the table and he recommended to both sides that the doctors should that this is the agreement or the
universities are required to top up that tuition payment so you know it is a real change in the way we're doing tuition and supporting students in the province
yes exactly they can expect the 30% off tuition and then there may be other adjustments because of their circumstances
will be much better off and the other thing is that each student when they make their application there are other considerations so it depends you know what the number of students in a family the family is supporting whether the student is going away from home to go to school all of those considerations are part of the calculator
in place and so that kind of collaboration talking to the provinces upfront
actually we didn't know exactly what was happening and in fact when he started to move people in the box were saying he's moving okay charles is moving and i would look over and he was standing perfectly still so i had no idea what was going on
that people have to make a decision about whether they're ready to accept that or not
