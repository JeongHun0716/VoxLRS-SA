of shooting sons of anarchy which i did right before i came to do this so i think i had maybe eight weeks or something like that to put on as much weight as i could
guys riding horses and sword fighting i said do they hire an actor that knows how to do those things my mom said i'm not really sure but i would imagine they hire someone else
one area you know he'd wanted to become you know one of the best boxers in the world and worldclass athlete and dedicated his entire life to that
to find a way to feel better or live in a healthier way and they
i love being in good shape not because of the aesthetic of it
reintegrating a normal pattern or rhythm of eating was very difficult after being so disciplined for four months about only existing on the bare minimum that i could i mean in terms of how you do it is really just starve oneself but it's also what became interesting
it never it felt good and it had the required effect and anytime i felt like it was a burden or a hardship i was quickly brought back to reality in that it paled in comparison to what fawcett himself went through
at what point it becomes an obsession is a great question i really don't know i certainly know that
it's a really interesting point it's the sort of the area that i was most interested in in making this film
challenges at one point or another in our lives that we have to try to overcome and i certainly could relate to that very very readily both in my career and in my personal life and there's a tendency to try to you know to maybe want to
to get to know each other really well and to just sort of stay in the vibe of the movie
my ritual i would wait till about 3 pm on christmas eve and then go and have a few bevy's with my best pal and then we'd go and try and do our christmas shopping from 4 pm
the day after we wrapped i just felt like i wanted to be in his place you know so
was the relationship with him my approach to working with him was sort of very gentle and nurturing and
film which was my sanctuary so that isolation and my love of film
i mean i always was i grew up in a very economically depressed place and i was really struck at a young age by the fact that everybody just was sort of in survival mode and people weren't really bringing forth the intention for their life you know and then i got moved when i was in my mid in my very early
desire to get out of the constraints that he felt of regular society and spend a bit more time in the natural world which was a consequence of him trying to find this
they were going to commit murder they were in an environment where something happened and something happened an environment and it was sat
your friends are telling you you got to do this bro there's no way out of this and all of a
there wasn't enough room for it to turn around so it decided it was going to go through
14 15 16 hours a day seven days a week was really an amazing gift
so we had you know we had some experiences but to me it was all just so exciting you know
and says well that's wonderful but i'm actually quite enjoying my life as it is so get somebody else to do that right of course it's not quite that simple
of the show had actually thought maybe i would actually have tattooed on me for real
longer breath but i also was on a tv show for seven years which is a different type of fame and it's almost a bit more frenzied or people feel more access that you're more accessible because you're in that living room every week
you know some magic on top and blow the scope way wider
i think that he put in a performance in this film that is going to really surprise people and i think it's going to be one of his career best performances to date i really do
carrier of it was the actual king you know that was really the only significance of it where we've
he's a lot sort of more rough and ready what we both were eager to avoid was
learning experience and period of growth working with guy
and he starts off and he's tough and he's streetwise and you know he's a little bit selfish but at the center of it he's got a good heart and you know he but he's doing great for himself he's got a lovely life worked out with his little crew in london
movie maybe three months after i finished doing sons so i'm sure there's flavors of him in there it certainly wasn't intentional though you know obviously you want every character that you play to be as original and unique and fresh as possible so you want to try to forget everything you've known but that was also my education on sons it was like going to an ivy league school
being on set and in the jungle but where i ran into a little trouble was in my hotel
to be in an environment like that but one there are certainly some challenges
i'm i late for work and i remembered the cat so i climbed up no cat up there
so i brought him down and put him under my armpit trying to
i did a lot of fighting did some muay thai boxing some jiujitsu guide the directors big into jiujitsu but mainly i set myself a goal of doing a thousand pushups a day minimum so
time set i'll show you and you ran up launched
didn't have to do any more shooting but like i said we were 45 minutes up a river so we were probably an hour and a half from the closest road so it was an unpleasant long journey
the spinning backflip and went face down onto the ground and
story about mankind coming together forget dropping our petty differences and creating some giant giant
you know because that's an area that's always interested me but the next acting job i'm doing is i'm going to i'm really excited i'm going to play king arthur with guy ritchie directing so we're sort of reinventing that myth and retelling that story
you say you can you know each room is connected and it just is kind of a fully realized rendering of this house
it's this absolutely fully realised incredible beautiful detailed interior of allendale hall the mansion
the process of it gave him that like now feeling of life like being really present in his life
business 12 to 14 hours a day so to stay to keep one's concentration for that long while starving
getting asked back to the party you know for somebody you know it's very hard to make a film you spend an enormous amount of time together and for somebody to express the desire to work with you again it's really flattering
weeks towards the end of arthur but it actually really wasn't bad so yeah i got sort of big i got probably bigger than i've ever been for arthur i got to about 190 pounds
such a smart actor that he always finds you know something internal something related
on set so although it was a bit disconcerting to begin with like
through two fingers but in terms of the impact yeah i'm definitely immensely proud to have been part of that
i'm still immensely proud of the impact that it had i don't know because it was my first
know and and so then and i had two films that came out back to back so i've been doing this now for six weeks straight five six sometimes seven days a week i've been in 20 countries in the last six weeks so i'm sure next week when i finally finish all of this and go back home it's gonna
when i think and talk about acting i'm much more comfortable talking about it in terms of being a craftsman that learns a trade and and tries to improve one's skill set through a career and apply a craft to it you know it makes me a bit nervous when you start to get highfalutin and talk about art and being an artist but at the same time
you know of being it felt reductive to me and i wanted to like move past that and let him
fear and faith and so yeah i could see that but you know i wasn't probably as aware at the time but in hindsight inevitably because i just finished
and no sound came out i said he is alive so i brought him down and put him under my armpit trying to warm him up
i went to one because it was the greatest two weeks of my life leading into the worst day of my life the most popular
we did it for so long and we all sort of fancied ourselves little you know outlaw
are embroiled in every day whether we recognize it or contextualize it in that specific vocabulary or not there's a version of that inherent in our daily struggle but you know at the center of it also it's
that one chooses to work with because as an actor you have very little input actually into the overall filmmaking process you have a certain level of autonomy
to try to show the physical manifestation of that and so when i first met guy he was very concerned about my physicality and he brought it up many many times actually through that conversation is where i believe i got the role because
separate rooms but you keep seeing each other going in and out of guys room and it's like a real sort of pressure cooker competition situation
i don't really believe in destiny per se as a predetermined thing
for this the biggest challenge for me was i think really just trying to understand what the correct tone of this film was gonna be it was we sort of set out to do something quite somber which is sort of right in my wheelhouse but then
process and so it's i believe that good
crown you know so it's almost like i think the offing was one of the first
kind of intimate personal human story and and so we would just talk
experienced a great tragedy and you know he basically
but you know it was great in a way i mean because i spent a lot of time in this comp art
trying on some trainers for my brother having a bit of a dance around drunk obviously
