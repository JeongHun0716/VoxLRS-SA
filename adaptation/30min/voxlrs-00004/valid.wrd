and if not by that point then you're gonna have to kind of retool
it would be presumptuous for anybody to leap to any conclusions like that
where things go and it will sort itself out over time i have no doubt but it will sort itself out based upon the best ideas we have under republican management that are appropriate for the future of this country
to get ready for criticism because america has been a world leader for a long time we get criticized we're always at fault we're always to blame everybody's always pointing a finger of blame at us and i used to tell them you're now on the world stage folks people are going to start criticizing you and you better get used to it

i think in republican politics it's less about personality everybody likes to play the name game
my life needed to go at that point which is as much about helping others as it is learning about yourself
get down to today's leaders and i think in china many of the emerging members of the fifth generation see north korea as a major irritant they have a they have an economy now to manage the chinese do they didn't have much to lose in the early days if things went south but they have they have a real economy to manage these days
nothing not predictable there but it will also be one of some collaboration and opportunity
economy and that would be regional security how you deal with north korea and iran and that would be i think if we get really smart about this relationship in the years to come how do we together pool our brain power that

to make it all happen so not just for me but a need for our entire family
and about openness and about human rights and about the role of the internet in society you can't stop that and the party is saying what do we do if we don't make accommodations if we don't make some changes and give a little bit in terms of liberalization we can see a headon coalition by 2015

i don't think the nation is ready for that and i think it'd be the worst possible thing we could do when our nation needs to begin to grow that is not a progrowth strategy we found that in our own state of utah
that i think is absolutely needed in today's environment you've got to understand the environment in which jobs are created it helps having been governor and rick's been a good governor and he's a good friend on top of that but it also helps to have been in the private sector where you actually are working with the banks and customers and suppliers in making a company go and that i have and i don't see a whole lot of other people
it's an 1800 mile border you've got to work with the four border governors in terms of getting their verification that in fact you've secured the border

when you make comments that fly in the face of what 98 out of 100 climate scientists have said when you call into question the science of evolution all i am saying is that in order for the republican party to win
of leadership coming up i think they get this part and you can only hold back people so long before you have to come up with a longer term internet strategy openness strategy that i think is consistent both with the political implications which are very real but also with the economic development implications and i'm guessing in the head of xi jinping
power is consolidated i think then reforms begin
and there are going to be technologies that work their way around whatever barrier you throw up
to get lee ray huan out of the politburo and so we're going to see changes every step of the way but i'm guessing we'll be with seven members of the standing committee
