but you also have personalities who rise up and capture their moment in history as president reagan did in 1980 no one else could have done that
my lack of attendance move the market or anything but i thought if you're going to be honest and sincere about how you feel then you probably ought to apply it to the convention as well
and of vision and of courage that is the human element in elections
and about problem solving at a local level that wasn't so complicated and a lot of what he talked about
you know pretty standard republican messaging but he took it a notch higher because he had it added an element of dignity
and it was a big tent that he built he was likable he was accessible
back to embracing that big tent concept and speaking in ways that are visionary courageous bold and representative of the greater aspirations of the american people i think we've strayed a bit from that
where it will be all for naught where you can have a person who meets their moment in history like in 1980 and rises up to capture the imagination of the american people and i think that's more the human dimension than the mechanical dimension of politics
which i thought made it the preeminent political party in the united states and so my in short my comment at the time was
it is a counter terror effort that we are waging this is going to go on for a whole lot of years into the future and not only in afghanistan
we have no choice pierce we have no choice other than to do home building right here in the united states of america
no i'm in the keep americans safe business we first and foremost need to you said revelation
at some point that may be something that we take a look at but i'll always be engaged in the affairs of this great country and hope to step up and help wherever i can
there's no question about that you have to be responsive to the the the the needs and desires of the voting population
and what that organizing theme is going forward i don't think anyone has established yet it might come out of this election cycle it may be counterterrorism it may be isis i don't know but right now in the absence of that overarching coalescence
second and if you don't meet market expectations you begin to atrophy pretty quickly
i'm a public servant first and foremost i always want to help my country where i can but you don't want to embark on a suicide mission
under the sec primary states which largely are big red states in the south in which he does relatively well so
but i'm not ready for a third party run until we have a complete collapse of a republican party that i can still believe
to get what they call the big mo once you catch capture that winning narrative after three or four or half dozen wins then you're you're off and there's very little that can stop that what i
until such time as we have a leader who's willing to work both sides of the aisle
we'll have to see given current rhetoric in the political marketplace the answer is no
his shadow as well as the shadow of this magnificent monument
from 10000 miles away is a picture of liberty opportunity and justice
every dollar of federal revenue will go to covering the costs of medicare social security
through no fault of their own something that is totally alien to them a sense that the deck is stacked
we must reignite the powerful jobcreating engine of our economy
secure in their rights and in love with their liberty
and i'm asking for the greatest privilege americans can bestow on a fellow citizen
our country will fall behind the productivity of other countries our influence in the world will wane our security will grow ever more precarious and the 21st century will then be known as the end of the american
we must make hard decisions that are necessary to avert disaster if we don't
i've lived overseas four times where the view of america
of utah when i was governor we cut taxes we flattened rates we balanced our budget we worked very hard to maintain our triple a bond rating status
they're joined my by my good friend paul chevalier a former marine and there we looked at america's greatest
let me say let me say first of all with respect to governor romney you know there are a lot of people who are tuning in this morning and i'm sure they're terribly confused after watching all the
i used to work for president reagan he said in the election of 1980 that we would cut our diplomatic links with beijing which had just been restored the year before under jimmy carter and recognize taipei as a legitimate
place to winning the election and then having to govern and dealing with the world as it is so at some point just like every president since ronald reagan in every election we've had the same
we're we're not going to come out so well so my guess is that sooner rather than later they're going to be
to a period of greater trust in our institutions of governance in our leaders and in our capacity to get things done as a country even across political boundaries
the north has blown off nuclear weapons without the chinese even being notified about
trouble i i've been around long enough becky i've heard this stuff before although as it relates to the one china policy this is a policy that both taiwan and china buy into so when you say that you're gonna make the one china policy a bargaining chip that that probably
recognize north korea for what it is it's a dangerous unpredictable almost suicidal state what we do know is that they've paraded an intercontinental missile
kind of a replay of what we've seen before trump at some point is gonna have to say i've gotta sit down and do business with the chinese i'm gonna have to cut deals i'm gonna have to work on security matters environmental matters even securing greater stability
