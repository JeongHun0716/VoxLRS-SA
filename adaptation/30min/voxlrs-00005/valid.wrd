well the us congress including myself strongly supports
and my concern would be that additional sanctions right now would simply strengthen the hand of the hardliners in iran who do not want an agreement in fact in my view that plays into the hands of people who do not want an agreement
could not be a pathway to developing nuclear weapon and nuclear weapons capability we believe that the heavy water reactor at iraq
forward but i think they've made it clear as part of the interim agreement that they
to the extent that we can resolve these matters at the negotiating table in a way that's satisfactory then that averts the possibility of other kinds
making sure that iran does not obtain a nuclear weapons capability and again i want to emphasize the fact that everything that's
which is why there's great concern people look at the iranian nuclear program and say what could iran possibly want with this huge enrichment infrastructure and so any agreement would have to dramatically dramatically limit that enrichment infrastructure
we want to make sure that that statement genuinely reflects
well my position has been that we should give the negotiations a chance but i continue to believe that sanctions are a good thing
system that ensure that that doesn't happen
unless there's an agreement and the very limited sanctions relief that exists
ability to enrich nuclear material so that it could be
and so if that's the iranian position then why not
i think there have been very important improvements in the pakistaniamerican relationship in large part because the pakistani government has begun to take actions
about the management of this program it was worth pointing out to the american people that had they had their way you wouldn't have had the $2 billion for it in the first place
so this is the entity that was set up by the federal government to encourage
and if the money is not being well spent that program should be canceled but for the most part those funds have leveraged private sector funds and contributions to help nonprofits that provide important services in the communities i mean we're in montgomery county
which was i think a great experience growing up with people from different cultures you really try to learn to put yourself in their shoes
need help and support just to go about their daily living in many cases
more recently they developed the peace corps response program it's a little different than the traditional program where you just have volunteers who don't necessarily have a lot of skills and background they have some but not
so much and it's important that people give back so i think
and going into a hut where it was very dimly lit and there on the wall of the hut was a portrait of president john f kennedy and the reason that portrait was there was because president kennedy launched the peace corps and the peace corps had provided important services to that village in terms of better sanitation
law from way back with legislation that kept the best
that they've got and depending on the nature of the crisis they can deploy them but it's not only crisis deployment now but that is still a big part of it
providing affordable care to about 18
so to speak there is servegov you can go there and that creates a whole menu of options that people can search so servegov here in montgomery county there are lots of service opportunities and there's also an organization or a sort of
absolutely i mean we still have to make progress on some of these big budget issues
and around the globe you know it's been 14 of the last 15 years
sure well first let me say something about the peace corps because it's a great program opportunity to serve
americans are a big hearted people and they really do want to give back to their community
and i have always been one that has tried to work hard to reach across party lines
nonprofits that are already based locally that already understand the local challenges and americorps volunteers provide just a little bit more knowhow there's a sort of a paid staff person who can then encourage more volunteers
offense and that has been the big story of this election rather than circling the wagons and just protecting our gains from last time we've stayed on offense and so in addition to defending i hope at the end of the day about 20 we hope to be on offense in up to 50
abortion quick because i want to move on the facts are not one penny of taxpayer money goes to planned parenthood or anybody else for abortion and what mike and his colleagues tried to do was use a
but now we still have people graduating with these huge debts so i have proposed along with people
2008 and 2006 election we picked up 55 seats in that period so that's where you begin to look but there are also other races where we have members who have been here for a longer period of time and so we're taking nothing for granted that's why your question is hard because we're going to take nothing for granted we understand that this is a difficult political environment
issue that they're going to go after certain democrats on democrats in districts where they've had a consistent prolife record and will continue to have a prolife record it is very disturbing to see that
was give consumers additional powers and strength visavis insurance companies it helped rein in the insurance companies and if someone wants to argue that we should let them loose again and let them discriminate against preexisting conditions for kids that's a tough argument
to the school lunch program that's not my figures those are the congressional budget office figures
hit everyone and everything else harder that's just simple math
here in the united states the president and the previous congress enacted a number of
and it was a failed approach there it would have been a failed approach here fortunately at the critical moment we were able to pass the economic recovery bill which did stop the freefall and turn the corner
constitutional amendment to balance the budget is the right way to go because what it does
that key question of balance so far been missing from the conversation when we sit down with our republican colleagues
indicated that the recovery bill helped to save or create up to 4 million jobs
our debt to gdp ratio on a stabilized basis at the end of the decade
cuts but also revenue to prevent the sequester from taking place for a year we actually didn't even get a vote on it but
of deficit reduction now that's not the way we want to do it there are better ways to do it just like there are much better ways of dealing with the
careful not to say it would end medicare it would radically change it and it would end the medicare guarantee and this is how it would do it currently under medicare you're assured a certain amount of support from the medicare program to meet your health needs
to various agribusiness interests around the country we also said that we should get rid of the subsidies for the biggest oil companies so we took a more balanced approach unfortunately our republican colleagues rejected
also have over 16 percent unemployment in the construction industry it simply doesn't make sense to have that kind of deep cut especially when the congressional budget office estimates that about one third of our current year deficit is as a result of underemployment the fact that the economy remains somewhat weak
responsibility and shared prosperity now on both these two fronts
current deficit problem is because there are too many people out of work so absolutely our priority has been to get people back to work and i mentioned the republican joint economic committee report cut and grow that was the same prescription that
longterm economic growth now the budget math is pretty simple if you refuse from the outset
we need to build a strong relationship between the united states and the united states
howard berman many of us worked on that legislation and we need to continue to expand sort of
and that goods made within those zones in pakistan would have dutyfree access to the us markets
somebody who's worked to put progressive ideas into action and on the table versus someone who just votes the right way
candidates in this race and the washington post and others have endorsed me and one of the arguments is that we want people who are going to take progressive ideas and actually
mcconnell has made no secret of the fact that he's playing what i think is a very cynical political game and so hopefully after this election season you know republicans will come forward and help participate in moving this country forward rather than just standing on the
gingrich who the other day made some comment to suggest that you know the president was some alien
thinker and he had the kenyan anticolonialist approach to the world look these are efforts to try and say the president is not one of us it's a very cynical
what it is they understand that we need to come together as a country to finally pull ourselves out of this economic challenge and that it doesn't make sense to have people making such calculated efforts to undermine the president of the united states in the sense of trying to make him appear like some alien being
big oil subsidies for oil and gas companies that are doing
an agenda for change to keep working on the economy we're going to need to have a substantial majority in the congress but we'll see i mean there are some signs there that if they were to continue
well first those races are really focused on local and state issues they had a big debate in new jersey on how to
sustainable for people who have health insurance right now we know their premium
to move us forward but it does tell you that they have not put any answers on the table i mean if you look at the health care reform debate they put forward
who can't afford any health insurance at all so it was a big night it obviously goes over the senate side we're hoping very much
they get this thing done so that we can get a bill to the president's desk by the end of this year
virginia we know had a lot of local transportation issues there were two other very important races on the ballot last tuesday that focused on federal issues those were congressional races we had one in california we had one in new york state and in both cases democrats won in the case of new york
the areas that it's they're targeting will result according to the congressional budget office in 750000
because clearly we have a white house and a president who are not realitybased you have a president who tweets out totally unsubstantiated allegations
distract people from the ongoing investigation between the trump campaign and the russians but this administration has been trying to interfere with that investigation and now you have the president
