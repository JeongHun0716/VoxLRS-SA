our democratic nominee is for president we're gonna be in good shape because they're gonna gal
these races today the republicans have had to spend an awful lot of money trying to defend what typically have been slam dunk republican districts no one knows the outcome of course until the polls close but the fact that the republicans have had to fight so hard to keep traditional really republican seats is a very bad sign for them
here's where i agree with our presidential nominee but here's where i disagree
republicans because of their financial situation have embarked on what they call the millionaire strategy they're just looking for people with deep pockets to run and a person with deep pockets doesn't necessarily have that contact with the community doesn't necessarily know the issues that are important to people on the ground so
running earned the respect from people on both sides of the aisle republicans and democrats alike and is known as a fierce advocate for her constituents
well there is no magic number we've gone from a situation where most people thought that we would be on defense this cycle just
nominee is regardless of who it is if it's any of the front runners in those districts where their position on national issues may not be attuned to the issues that are important to a particular congressional district it provides our members our democratic members of the congress action an opportunity to say to their constituents
who could argue with over a million dollars and obviously in the house the republicans didn't even agree with their own speaker on a million dollars look the president as we all know
well john i think you know and we'll probably say the same thing on this until we know exactly
the interest savings and 1 point 2 trillion dollars in revenue they can't get that kind of balance
fact check first of all you got to get your facts right the budget that we brought and we did have an alternative budget that got an overwhelming democratic vote did not say we're only going to raise taxes on people over a million dollars it actually supported the president's proposal so you got to check your facts what we're asking for in the house is the same thing that the republicans
thousand should be the threshold as part of a larger agreement the issue is the balance between
look at the president's budget look at the president's proposal to congress september
that's proposing the senators couldn't tell us the details it's impossible to know it depends on the deal all i know is that democrats in the house are very determined to avoid going over the fiscal cliff but we want to make sure that any agreement asks folks at the very high income levels to pay a little bit more to reduce our deficit because if you don't ask them to pay a little bit more everybody else gets hit that much harder
in the house have refused even one penny so far from people earning more than a million dollars that is not balanced which is your position
just allow a vote in the house the republicans got a vote in the senate on their proposal
first thing the democrats did was require transparency and accountability under earmark reforms making sure that everybody had to take responsibility for what they were asking for we're more than happy to explore a greater earmark reform going
well i think we now know why they kept this secret for so long and i think you've just put your finger on what
and a two hundred thousand average tax cut for the top one tenth of 1 percent
and substance abuse those benefits are finally making some difference in these rural areas as well as the urban and suburban
billion dollars of tax cuts if you're in the one tenth of one percent you're going to get an average tax cut of two hundred thousand dollars if you're a millionaire you're
and those are exactly the people that you know donald trump went to during the campaign saying that nobody was listening to them
i think it's beginning to break up up from from all sides and the more people take a look at this the more they're asking the questions that we're talking about this morning and other
tax cut around 50000 dollars they even put in a provision here that provides tax cuts for the bonuses that insurance companies pay to their ceos so you add all that up to 600 billion dollars and yes the people who are being appointed to the trump camp
i i got to this is not what donald trump talked about on the campaign trail he talked about the issues that you and joe were just talking about the squeeze on working america
in the long term to medicaid but also the fact that the affordable care act benefits right now help people with opioid addiction
have handguns from other states that don't have those laws coming into maryland and increasing the homicide rate so we want to save lives by encouraging other states to adopt similar laws
too many distractions not enough training a pretty damning report there so i'm hoping metro will get on the ball and start implementing these recommendations immediately
report about metro from the fta laying out a series of directives that metro needs
know is that over 80 percent of the american public supports you
is it in congress you don't give up from the beginning right you try to lay the groundwork and build support over time to get things done everything we've done
well i don't know what the chances are what i do know is i will continue to oppose so called fast track authority and the reason i will continue to oppose it is it does not provide congress with enough input and
has many many serious flaws it's got a lot of shortcomings so as of now there's no reason to grant fast track updown authority to what i believe is a flawed agreement at this point in time
the hands of criminals people with a criminal record and people who pose a risk to the community so
to adopt similar provisions because right now although maryland has adopted
including the fact that it does not have a provision to deal with a currency manipulation
a tax tsunami about to crash down on the heads of the american people the amt is going to hit
