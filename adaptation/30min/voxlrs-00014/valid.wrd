well it certainly drove his camera crew crazy because the shot was
and it's not exactly where you want to be and it's uncomfortable and it's scary and some days it's good and some days it's not
it's more a blessing than anything else i wouldn't be sitting here talking to you
not there anymore and then she started to drink and drug
it was a great i think opportunity for me to get to know one of my idols growing up
early part of my career i understand it i've made it work for me but i've always felt that i was a character actress in some way
a couple of shorts that he'd done i read the script and i thought why is no one campaigning to play this role this is so well written this is a touching film it's sweet it's a love story it's also incredibly tragic
no i always found them as the ultimate accessory for me i think they reflect your mood reflect your outfit on sex and the city working with pat field was such a pleasure she was our stylist and the last the cherry on the top always for any outfit
confusing in real life god knows the things that people have said to me and inferred especially after a couple of drinks but in reality
said to me he said well you know three hours is four play i said you've got to
and we put together a story of what that sex had been like
yes well you know i just really couldn't find something that was sort of original and new and
courageous and the thing that i loved about her the most was that she was not judgmental
such an extraordinary artist and such a lovely man is he's very present
for people my age who are not being addressed in the entertainment world so hopefully shows like sensitive skin there'll be more of them if this is successful and people enjoy it which i hope they will
the woman is going through a midlife crisis i'm still trying to break through barriers
and he said that he would like to come and see the play that i was doing which was anthony cleopatra at the liverpool playhouse
seen a scene like this before it becomes addictive especially for women's stories
well sometimes i feel that i disappoint people because i don't have the right thing to say or a funny line but i'm not
and taking a show that i love and believe in and sharing it with people and really getting the feedback we've shown a little bit at different
i could be this character of a certain age who was still incredibly vital
model role model that i had would probably be madeline kahn in the frankenstein movie that she did with gene wilder
not to the extent but there was paparazzi and there were a lot of people in marrakesh who know the show quite well and enjoy it they kept calling me samantha so i knew something was up
on and off camera we've grown up together this has been 14 years in our lives and when we met i'm 10 years older than the other girls so they were in their early thirties i was in my early forties but that seems like a lifetime ago so much has happened so much good has happened i think from the show i think that it's encouraged women to come together again
it really does get better and it starts with you taking the time and the energy and the commitment to find out what works for you
oh well here i'm absolutely terrified because it's my first big professional being on television talk show as with the joan rivers who i just idolized i used to watch her on the ed sullivan show so i see that i'm really scared my voice is slightly high like this and terrified because i never knew where she was going to come from and i was sort of waiting and i remember waiting
when a woman is going through menopause her partner is as well you have to join forces because
going through her first hot flash experience and it was incorporated into an episode of sex and the city
or physical it really is a change chord in your life and you really have to look at those factors that
because she's got so many choices she's so empowered but to play somebody who has i think some more heart and dimension than that series allowed samantha to have and really tell the truth about what a lot of women are facing which is not pretty it's kind of ugly it's hard getting older yeah we need to tell these stories though yeah we do we do these are american
if you come out and support it we might get legs give monica legs
who leads you slowly but deliberately into a trap and then
respect for him so i think that she feels that
like the characters in the film the same kind of climactic effect
it was so terrific because i got to kind of transform myself
similarly to sex and the city in the sense of making it about the city that you live in
that kind of chemistry was not lost the dialogue the wit just the way michael patrick king has interwoven these four women's lives and continues to do it so successfully i really have he's such a great talent i think he did a terrific job
and then i read that they were doing a television version and i thought oh i've got to talk to mammoth and see if i can get involved in some way
you have no idea how many men i've had to sleep with to get this award
not just the people who already know his music but sort of legends from the past and bringing people together in a way that i feel
and how it affects him in a very deep emotional way and i think that's why i still listen to his music and it still affects me not just because of the memory but also he writes about fame and loneliness and isolation
available men always do that because it's very safe to flirt but a single man wouldn't say that
well most of all of my professional life i've been objectified to some degree
personally i'm a big fan of it are you in the sense of yes i want to look my best you know i want to it's listen they photoshop babies never mind
so i feel that this kind of work is really important but first of all it should be entertaining it's not just about me looking in the mirror feeling sorry for myself
touching her face and around her eyes and her neck and i feel great empathy for the character and and even for myself being that raw and exposed
instead of part of the fabric of life if you're lucky enough to age and i you know to really
a girlfriend of mine sang to me and she'd already turned 50 and i said what is it like she said you know you wake up in the morning and you just really don't give a sh**
who i was a huge fan of and other shows like the office and he said to me john plowman was his name is his name and he said we would like to develop something for you and there's a series i think that you should take a look at just to see this writer and his work and it was this show half hour comedy which i love that format anyway
i got on stage with kevin hearn at the keyboard where the extra mic was and started doing it and lou turned around and looked at me i've never seen him so angry in my life
and i thought what is sensitive skin is it about beauty products i mean what is this
i uh after sex and the city ended i really it was kind of a bit of a tough time for me i mean first of all this great series that i love so much and um the end of some personal things and then my dad was diagnosed with dementia which was really sad so i i
it's kind of a dream because the more you play a character the better you know it and the better it gets infused with
with it constantly she's also still speaking from the mount of experience that she has
i think on sex and the city we've been so fortunate as actors to play these characters over such a long period of time
no i mean i think after about the fourth season i think we recognized that we had hit a nerve we were a zeitgeist so to speak but a zeitgeist is usually of the moment
it was jamie lee curtis and myself and sharon glass we were all under contract at universal studios and i remember i was here at toronto free and i was making about $250 a week and loving it
30 pages in seven years of your life and i had just turned 40 and i thought you know i don't really think i can pull this off i don't think i can be this sex maven at this time in my life maybe they should you know
well something incredible happened in the four years that we were no longer making the series which was quite extraordinary because when we left four years ago we were a half hour show on cable that was successful critically and we had a very strong
relationship affect their partner and i think it's made a lot of men more conscious i mean i remember one episode where one of the characters was broken up with on a postit
we were both up on our feet which is very unusual we have a wonderful director in mary eyre
fabulous ideas and how to apply how to start a wardrobe a professional wardrobe for a woman that little black dress all those wonderful things that i sort of learned along the way
