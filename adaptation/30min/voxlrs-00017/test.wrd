cambridge at some point to see steve and jane jonathan and the hawking children they have been so kind to us the whole way through this process and it's i'm one of those people when i watch a film i believe what i see on screen and and so our responsibility to tell their story truthfully and authentically was
that i sort of wake up in a few days and go did that did that happen
huge fans of those them from old and yeah i they learned a lot from them from watching them daily
workwise i've always had a fight for the jobs and and fought pretty hard for them certainly for the theory of everything and so as far as where you go from here i just retaining employment will keep me very happy
next 10 years do you know i wish i wish i could say that there was a plan that the interesting thing is the danish girl the film i'm shooting at the moment was a film that tom hooper who i was working with on les misrables he gave me that script then and so
how did i feel how did i feel i don't i mean the fact that it was cate blanchett giving it i mean i i did a film called the golden age elizabeth the golden age with cate and it's one of the first films i did and i just think
the film we knew we weren't going to be able to shoot chronologically so we're going to have to jump into different stages in stephen's life and within the same day and so i i didn't want for stephen
playing yesterday and i go back tomorrow and i go arrive on tuesday morning and go straight onto set so this
she was so calm she i was hol i was holding for a bit while she was being really calm and she cried and i gently
no and it's that hilarious thing by which when before you're a parent you sort of hear people talking about that
it's set in jk rowling's wizarding world it's set 70 years before harry potter and it's about this english magizoologist
yeah so we which was so we had this fan event for fantastic beasts and we were all there and then
hannah was totally on time but the but the baby was late and so iris appeared in the world and i gave her a stern talking to yeah
jk rowling arrived which was again a complete shock for us and whenever she comes we we turn into sort of excitable children and
flying and of course we were on a flight with basically most of the british olympic team and there was this fear that what if she cries lots and then they don't sleep and then they blame all of their lack of success
at three o'clock in the morning and you go in and you're sort of gently furious and then you get a little smile and your heart breaks a bit and it's totally worth it
i know we went to the olympics when iris was like eight weeks old and it was it was the most sort of astounding invitation and
scripts it's just the dialogue that you see but when you read her script it was like reading one of her books the intricacy of the detail and it was like you were taken back to all those things that you kind of love in
and i remember doing it was when i was just starting out and they were in this photograph there was a sort of there was a a model and me an actor wannabe actor and a
and mario tostino who i'd never worked with who is one of the most extraordinary brilliant people but he's just almost in that moment he was almost like a sort of parody of himself so
i'm huge fans of those them from old and yeah i they i learnt a lot from them from watching them daily
that love story and story about authenticity and bravery and so i'm really in the middle of that project at the moment and it just i was filming on friday night
illness was of very little interest to him after he was diagnosed he's someone that lives forward and lives passionately and that
got plane yesterday and i go back tomorrow and i i go arrive on tuesday morning and go straight onto set so this feels like a wild weird dream that
cambridge at some point to see stephen jane jonathan and the hawking children they have been so kind to us the whole way through this process and it's i'm one of those people when i watch a film i believe what i see on screen and and so our responsibility to tell their story truthfully and authentically
i mean i i did a film called the golden age elizabeth the golden age with cate and it's one of the first films i did and i
how did i feel how did i feel i don't i mean the fact that it was cate blanchett giving it
an exceptional actor and so i was recovering from that excitement of seeing her and then then just trying to bury all this frenzy of nerves and white noise and try and speak articulately and of course you then forget everything but it just felt like a euphoria really an extraordinary euphoria one like there's something i will not forget now
and and and so there were loads of elements of of the moment where there's a moment where colin is at the house that marilyn monroe's staying at and he goes to the loo in the middle of the night and sees her sort of looking
who's written as many diaries as he did he wrote two pieces the prince the showgirl and me and and my week with marily and and as an actor that's a kind of amazing resource because you have literally moment by moment documented so that was fantastic and i think it was interesting because on the set you had michelle
ask i was just sort of in the zone but it was wonderful one of the great things about this film was we shot
an excuse to sort of indulge in that and and i had no idea that she was as formidable an actress as she was people often say that
windsor castle we we apparently got permission from the queen to shoot outside outside so the moment when we drive up to the gate that was that was windsor castle no i think it was
how often those performances that look as if they've they're sort of you know completely free have taken a vast amount of work so
a few months later and i went up to toronto where michelle was shooting a film and we did a screen test there and a
and that's amazing because you walk down this one corridor and you have sort of marilyn monroe tottering down you then have a sort of dismembered pirate and a you know and a sort of sort of french parisian something or other so that was that's the stuff that make dreams are made of so that was so that was great
well there was one anteater who who was newborn and she had this habit of sort of
