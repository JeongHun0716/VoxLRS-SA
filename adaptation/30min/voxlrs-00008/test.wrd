from as well as arm chips and chips from other manufacturers so we're embracing that and you see
so i guess if you think broadly about our company i suppose we compete most with ibm because they are
but because the company's strategy was changing i'm not sure they quite knew what was
and here's what i'm seeing and our partners are taking advantage of this which is
of their apps were written you know on windows so we remain
you're right i mean so one of the things that i really focused on when i came to hp and i've been here for about two years was getting back our momentum in terms of innovation and being a thought leader in the industry and that is of course in hp's
so our wireless lan product and networking is what every company requires to manage byod
lower but we we aim to get it around the world as fast as we possibly can are
we are really when what i have said to our organization when in doubt
as much as we can of all those products through the channel so our breadth is our strength and people say to me all the time
but we would be able to provide a spectrum of devices for an enterprise to most carefully match up that
so i'm going to run for governor of california and we're here today in fullerton california to make the announcement official
business climate in california creating jobs and keeping jobs cutting government spending and fixing education and the way you do that is through
well i'd say ronald reagan or pete wilson did a better job and you know the state was in quite good shape when when pete left he left with a 12 billion dollars surplus but i will tell you this is all about leadership and it's all about focus and i want to focus
to let california fail i refuse to sit by and watch what is happening to this state i love the state where i built
and you know what i think if you have a huge need to be liked actually
actually i think it's an advantage right now because the people of california and i have traveled up and down this state are really angry at sacramento they are tired of the politicians they're tired of the politics and i think they want someone with a fresh set of eyes who's created jobs who's run this
because californians they want california to be great again but they recognize that we have to change the way we do business here or we're going to continue on a slow downward spiral which no one wants
my husband became a doctor our two boys were born here and i think we can change the direction of california but it will take a different approach that's for sure
so let's take a pause let's make sure we understand the economic impact this was put into place when we had a 4 point 6 percent
so over the last year i've done over 300 campaign events many of which are open to the press and so i think i've been pretty accessible and what i'm trying to
rate today it is 12 point 3 percent and let's take a pause make sure we understand what we've got
in every way i know how is get the message out to californians you know people want to know what i stand for they want to know the approach i will take and that's what we've
to 11 percent he came with a surplus left with a billion dollar deficit
on those three problems let's get the right people working for the governor you know you're only as good as the people who work for you so those appointments are incredibly important you've got to use the veto pad and you've got to
3 things at 100 percent as opposed to try to do 10 things at 50 percent and in california what i want to focus
years of my career as results i know how to fix things i know how to lead and i tell you i think this is very very important and i think what scott brown showed and it was an earthquake i mean
you know in california and i can't speak as well for the country but in california this is all about leadership
we've got to go every agency every department and say do we still need
and getting people to focus on three things and if you are off doing lots of different things and i will tell you firsthand in politics the gravitational pull to try to please everyone is enormous and you just gotta have this
don't feel like the government's working for them that it's a problem and you know what if we can create the
can we use technology to do more with less what's fascinating about california for
to grow and thrive then i think people will feel a lot better about their opportunities and they've got to feel that the process is working in washington
and congress to lead on getting the cost down at the federal government here's the bad news we have a government we can no longer afford and we better face up to that reality and we better start trying to figure out how we're going to get it back into line with what we can afford
and you have and you don't understand the conditions that are required to create jobs i think it's a huge
you know i think the american people want congress to be accountable they want the president to be accountable
i'm a proven job creator i have spent 30 years creating jobs working in the private sector i bring the
with less and then perhaps our biggest problem is the public employee pension problem which is
for holding on to these big companies i don't need the credit you know what i've learned to
issues and and he was right i'm right we need more jobs here but here's the difference between
and then we're going to have an economic development team that's going to hang on to jobs here in california so that will
or we're going to run out of money in california so it's getting californians back to work
job with the right skills on the same agenda as the governor and we're going to all march in the same direction
more deliberately and importantly from an internal perspective we will more
and i had to make it was the very first decision i had to make and my conclusion was that we had to put the company back together and we had a lot of stable
a a smaller set of products that each management team will focus on and we will even accelerate the innovation engine fast
so we're really focused on what's the value proposition for the end customer as well as our partners and i have to say the partner reaction today and the customer reaction was universally positive because what they know is we'll be a bit more
what we know is that this is the right thing for not only our customers
rewards to results when you run a hundred and ten billion dollar company which is what i run today what someone does in the server business in france
also very importantly our partners most of you probably know that our products business we sell through value added resellers and distributors in fact 85 percent of our pro
and we are such a much stronger company today and so
accomplished over the last three years we have repaired the balance sheet so we went from 12 and a half billion dollars of debt on the operating company to 4 point 7 billion
