it all kind of fits together but that was a super fun episode and we had an awesome time working with her and promoting something so worthwhile
but for this one it was actually this one was started i guess by an episode of victorious where rex is actually a talk show host named
so i hate watching myself but the blooper episode the last one that we did was the one that i will watch repeatedly because it was just us goofing off and being ourselves
where i actually filmed one of them and i guess it's on theslapcom where i play myself but they carried it over and for this new one called electric bloopaloo
so they have the shells laying around they have the spaghetti and the meatballs and i'll be darned if i didn't make myself a few of those
a long time ago that he was doing this and again i had no idea what it was about but when i was looking at the email for this there was another email that i got years ago that said that he had booked this movie
schnoodle named oscar and i love him he's very much a puppy we got him in december and he's still kind of mischievous but we're dealing with it he's adorable
point where you just always have the same one like go to the gym more stop eating crap all the time you know so those have just kind of become my like new year's refreshers i guess
so yeah but as far as just tornadoes i have had a warning siren go off but it wasn't close enough that we actually had to do anything about it i think the closest disaster i had was a wildfire
it's been great from what i've been able to see i only got to see one goal so far which i was disappointed by but i'm glad i got it right at that moment but yeah i've been up in the 300 level
you guys have been so receptive and welcoming and kind and gracious and all the staff here at the manitoba moose team they've been awesome i've had a really really great time and i feel very welcome
yeah well actually we shot two days so i had to put it on in the morning and then take it off that day and then i had to put it on the next morning isn't that a lie
my dad wants ucla so yeah i'm a diet you're not a
yeah so that one's called i saved your life and that was a really really cool episode to shoot i got to wear like casts and stuff because i was supposed to be hit by a moving vehicle so yeah so i got to wear a cast tell us about this
guilt of that when he realizes that he is the reason why his brother is missing because he encouraged him to go off with caitlyn they went off and did their thing and now they're in all this trouble i think trey has a little bit of guilt in that and he wants to rectify it by going out with his dad and rescuing him
i didn't know that the storm was gonna come it was my fault so he he's the one who brings these guys together and then i think the
be extremely cool because the maze runner looks absolutely amazing
yeah i mean i get teased about pretty much everything that i do in one way or another
so i ruined a whole take because you know every time you did that 150 extras had to walk through the door before me so they had to reset all of that because i went in at the wrong time it was like i just felt like in the grand scheme of things they weren't really that big of a deal but because i didn't know it was my first time really doing this i was
everything is just completely different and it's it's great jumping between the two not not only you know comedy and drama but film
i really don't even know if i belong in a house i think i'm just a straight up muggle but if i was to pick one i would probably want to be
gratifying you know when people like what you do and you know you're walking down the street
i will walk out of the room i can't handle a tv that's on like level 12 because it's unacceptable you have to beat either 10 or 15 there's no middle ground 20 if you're feeling really brave but besides that everything has to be in fives i feel like there's no point in them even
it look great and yeah you would never know it but one of the cool things like the story of bruce the shark on jaws
dance together and then gibby basically cancels at the end and sam's really kind of upset about it so people are thinking wow maybe sam actually kind of has it in for gibby and the fact that he turned her down was kind of disappointing to her and all his stuff so i could
we were definitely pretty shocked it's always a little bit of a challenge to know that somebody is going to be
actually one time it actually worked out pretty cool i was able to be an extra in the episode
so that was 2004 and then late 2006 i got the audition for icarly
you know basically it breaks down to us doing an episode a week and we rehearse monday tuesday wednesday and then shoot thursday friday and so through the course of the day we have to get on average three hours of school in
going into it i had never worked on one project basically for more than a week
he's so confident with himself and he's always quite the party boy neville's just kind of evil so gibby is definitely cool
right exactly i mean i definitely prefer icarly over a little bit part on drake and josh because this is so much more
the movie came out i was always talking into a microphone onto a blank screen so i never saw my character until the movie came out and then see and
absolutely nuts and i thought this was the pinnacle of it and i was blown away everybody was like oh yeah no no by saturday
and i think that obviously people are just going to assume that it's a phenomenal looking special effects computer generated movie but i think you can see that pretty clearly from the trailers but i think what people are going to be really surprised by is the story of the human element and i hope that's what people enjoy out there
that's true there's some people you know who play everything on expert it's like literally you just see a blur of fingers and everything i will never get to that phase of my guitar playing but
i'd say maybe like 200 or 210 something like that but i've never tried my trainer is very much against bench press in general just because he says it puts way too much strain on the joints and there's a lot more exercises that you could use that are more productive
in the news lightning became a thing there was a lightning storm in venice beach and a boy was in the water lightning hit the water right next to him and he died
