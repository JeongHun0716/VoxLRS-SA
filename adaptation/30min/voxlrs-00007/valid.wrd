saying to the australian people it's alright don't worry we don't have to undertake any reform she'll be alright well she won't be alright
that's the challenge every government faces well i mean that's up to the us but so far he hasn't had great success and you never know hopefully he can do what he wants to do as president but we all face those challenges but we've got to do what we believe to be right for the nation and he's doing what he believes to be right for the united states
