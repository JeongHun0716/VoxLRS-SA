big difference between byelections and general elections and in this general election for principal questions who do you want to be prime minister at the end of it now with
it's how people love each other and you know i'm a churchgoer too i don't have any problem in saying that i think the gay sex is absolutely
the steps that we're going to take the steps the prime minister believes that we need to take in order to deal with the
the european union until now has been assumed to have a better hand to play but the prime minister we now see has actually
as a deterrent if you know that you're going to have to put your council tax up to a referendum then you will be a little bit more respectful of people's money
well the critical question is can we give people the chance to set up new schools or the chance to change the management of schools where they're unhappy and if they take that opportunity then not only will it provide them with an opportunity which they've been denied so far it will also act as a goad and a spur to improvement elsewhere and if
yes i think that mrs thatcher was wrong in the way in which she starved local government of power i've got great admiration for many things that happened in the 1980s but one thing that went wrong is that we starved local institutions of the oxygen that they needed to grow and in that respect there were some other conservative politicians who were right
it's obviously going to be important to ensure that the rights of the irish people
we know that if you remove that on fuel then fuel bills will be cheaper than they otherwise would be ah otherwise would be
we if we left would have control of all of that money which means that not only would science not
a talented figure
i think that andrew did very well during the leadership campaign and of course having
well i have an open mind i mean part of the purpose of as i say in this conversation is to say how can we construct an immigration policy that allows people to come here to study and to work but in numbers that we control and that we can benefit from and if you are embarking on a policy commission and the explicit you know
and there were the british voters who decided that we should leave the european union and now i'm working with maurice glassman my friend a labour peer in order to make sure that we implement leaving the european union in a way that chimes with the verdict that the british people recall
hard brexit is a phrase that's used in order to try to make what is a liberation seem like a punishment but i do believe that we should be outside the single market absolutely and that's what people voted for
i don't know i think overall it was a mistake but the thing i did manage to get right was to argue that we should leave the european union and 174 million people agreed with me and therefore we now have as politicians an obligation to honour that decision to respect it and to implement it
wrong i think that the way in which the decision was
it certainly was not that is the accurate figure for the amount of money that the european union controls and i myself am in favor of increased nhs spending but since i'm not the health secretary or the chancellor of the exchequer i can't deliver that yet but we may be
no i think that that characterisation of things is
about grading and the curriculum that we wouldn't expect to be the
of what went wrong i think were visible to many of us one of the problems with education in england for many years now has been
the sorts of answers that we come up with reinforce what margaret thatcher once argued which is that the facts of life are conservative people want to see schools with good
that they have nothing to lose because they haven't been given this sort of moral scaffolding that allows them to tell right from wrong adequately
in terms of what the test of a good school is that sliding skill depends on the enthusiasm of the students that is the principal way in which i can judge whether or not a school is really outstanding the fact that people here are really keen to let me see them doing things that they love is a sign that this is a good thing
well i'm really impressed by the fact that people learn through doing
these are facts and these facts are also a story
who said that the pound rises the pound falls but britain is a strong country and that it will see its way through am i
because the european union is a big bureaucratic and unwieldy organisation that
are suffering as a result of our membership of the european union their wages are lower
well i've already pointed out to you a number of facts which you haven't denied
also also look at the facts of unemployment in southern europe youth unemployment in greece is
and in fact it's perfectly clear what we would do if we voted to leave the european union
want our democracy restored and who believe that britain should be a selfgoverning nation
my point is that i'm glad that all these organisations are not on my side
the working people of this country at last get a fair deal i think the people in this country have had enough of experts with organized
organisations like jcb which manufacture globally organisations like
more than £360 million to the european union we send £20 billion gross a year we get some money back but the money that we get back the rebate we cannot count on the rebate is decided at a european level it's not in the treaties it's not a guarantee and as the chancellor of the exchequer has pointed out that rebate can be altered to our disadvantage
all sorts of people would attack me personally but i love my country i could not recommend that boris was prime minister i had tried to make that work and therefore it would have been a genuine betrayal of principle and of this country to have allowed boris's candidacy to go ahead with my support
i made it clear that i did not believe that boris should be prime minister after having worked incredibly hard over the past
it's been laid out in some clarity in the newspapers boris had the opportunity to build a team boris had the opportunity to lay out a particular vision in the last 24 hours and i felt that he did not step up to that challenge and there was a deadline
my political life i've asked myself one question what is right for this country and if there is a personal cost to me i will bear it
is not interested in doing is spreading home ownership and he made that perfectly explicit well we think that it is right that we should spread home ownership at the moment it's not fair that if you live in a
we do because over the last five years we haven't reduced spending in supporting people who have disabilities i think the idea that any government led by david cameron would actually make the lives of disabled children or families with disabled members more difficult simply doesn't
is a democrat and a patriot to his bootstraps when we had a vote in the house of commons on intervention in syria in the last parliament the vote went against what the prime minister argued for and what i believed in
well i completely disagree with alexander tomerko on that again as i mentioned earlier i'm a free speech guy i respect the rights of people to
all of us would want our daughters to grow up to be like she was an amazing person and i can only grieve for her and in particular
what it would be would be an affirmation of faith and hope in britain and i think that britain would be taking its place alongside countries like australia canada new zealand and america as a selfgoverning democracy democracy is one of the great gifts
i explained that i didn't think that the situation would arise
but i don't think that we politicians should mark our own homework i think it's important for us to outline what we believe and then let the people make a judgement
absolutely i struck up a conversation with her at the time and had a few subsequent conversations
politicians including theresa may have said that at the moment they don't think that's right in particular i in the course of this debate have pointed out that president erdogan the president of turkey has been taking his country in a direction which i don't think is aggressive
who run daily risks and as justice secretary i think of prison officers those who work in our court system and police officers as well while i've been justice secretary there have been horrendous assaults against prison officers and of course there's been the murder of a police officer as well on merseyside
just that so for that reason i strongly support theresa in these negotiations and as prime minister and i do agree with david that the stronger her hand the better the deal that she'll be able to secure for britain
sometimes there would be a request from the media that you might want to accept in order to appear but your first priority was to get things right in your own department to talk to those people who were responsible for delivering services and to make sure that patients or in my case parents and pupils came first
yes i am last year of course during the the tumult of the leadership election i put myself forward and
these people are the same ones who got consistently wrong
i don't think it is because one of the striking things about this debate is that those who are arguing that we should remain have a vested financial interest
i could not be prime minister i'm not equipped to be prime minister i don't want to be prime minister
i think boris is entirely entitled as the mayor to speak up for london he was elected on the basis that while he was a conservative to his bootstraps he was also someone who when he felt that the city would benefit from having an independent voice he'd be that independent voice
that in 2015 students will start studying for these examinations and in 2017 they will sit them for the first time will be more than enough time and people can prepare now for the sort of change that we're going to make
one the bbc understands very well between being a reporter who allows a politician to speak for themselves as you're doing now and an individual who can form a judgement about what they say
well i think that they require very very different skills but we've got a very good prime minister at the moment in theresa may and a very good ambassador in kim daedak
approach involved both the times and bilt and the presidentelect thought it was a good idea to talk to britain's best newspaper and the most successful newspaper on the continent of europe
well we asked specifically whether or not he would stand by what is said on nato
no no no no i like being a member of parliament for surrey heath and i love writing for the time
i didn't watch it but i heard about it i was surprised that boris had decided to withdraw actually at the time
a talented figure but of course i lost and there you go and i think the thing is that if you are defeated in any election
economy there are some people including the former governor of the bank of england mervyn king who argued that sterling was overvalued beforehand and it's certainly given a competitive edge to our economy but there were lots of commentators yourself included adam who were
gloat all i would do and have done is point out firstly that there were lots of people during the run up to the referendum who said that britain's economy would be plunged into recession that hasn't happened there were lots of people who said that we would see a flight of capital from this country that hasn't happened i think in the papers today glaxosmithkline had recorded
to trust me i'm asking the public to trust themselves i'm asking the british public to take back control of our destiny from those organisations which are distant
it's a real figure which we've already had
my point is that i'm glad that all these organizations are not on my side i'm glad
policy isn't in the hands of the british people i think that we should take back control so that people like you and others can debate and decide how many people can come here
take away vat on fuel if he left the european union one of the problems about being in the eu is that you can't once vat has been slapped on a project
is the ingenuity the creativity and the strength of the british people many of those who are arguing that we should remain are trying to frighten you by saying that it would be impossible for britain to
every week we send actually more than 350 million pounds to brussels
but you mustn't inhale the truth is that i prefer i prefer
was born and brought up in scotland i'm i consider myself to be scottish and british at the same time and i'm proud of our united kingdom its history and its traditions and one of those
and that has meant additional pressure on accident and emergency and additional pressure on gps as well
can achieve amazing things if only we trust the next generation
to strengthen and to reinvigorate our democracy because our democratic tradition
the leave campaign is not an alternative government the leave campaign are a group of people who believe that the government that we elected a year ago should take this country out of the european union
that the european union is growing slower than every continent in the world apart from antarctica it's a fact that if we vote to leave and we take back control then we can shape an economic policy which is in our interests britain's been strong in the past and can be strong in the future
and june the 24th if we voted to leave then we're in a different world as far as relations with these countries are and i think that they will recognize our democratic vote
on fuel to heat and light their own home i've said if we leave the european union
you've had your day unelected unaccountable elites i'm afraid it's
this debate but it's perfectly clear the legal basis is that if you're ordinarily resident and you've got legal right entitled to a property in another european union country then that will be respected and you can enjoy
the working people of this country at last get a fair deal i think the people in this country have had enough of experts with organisations from acronyms had enough of experts the people of
weakening our border controls so that we cannot keep out criminals and we cannot kick out terrorists there have been detailed proposals
here in london in the world and i think that we're uniquely fortunate to live in the best country in the world and it's because i think this country is so great and because i believe its people are so wonderful
making sure that our children grow up with wider horizons i think it's critically important to make sure that we have a balanced approach towards immigration because our country has succeeded in the past by being open by being inclusive by being a united kingdom
nicola sturgeon because she's a very effective operator but what i fear is that if we have nicola and alex salmond determining what happens then we will have the government of the united kingdom shaped in the interests of only one part of the kingdom rather than all of us and i think that would be a mistake
steve i can tell you i'm absolutely not um the one thing i can tell you is that the
well britain will be in a position as any sovereign independent nation is where it can set the taxes and set the rules
