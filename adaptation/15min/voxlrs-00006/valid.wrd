that everything is being said for the first time and i think it's one of the great gifts that an actor has to have but it's probably underappreciated because
they just say well this is it what do you think what do you think what do you think and what i would find that because i have done this very many times and audiences some people would sit there and say oh it was lovely it was funny
well here we go and the english cast was saying oh did they laugh at this in a minute
the gym otherwise you're cheating yourself and the audience and everything you've got to tell every step of the way and that is the
the city added up so it became another character whereas on the stage we talk to the audience we explain the thing and the abstraction we chat with them
i've gotten from an audience of test screenings whatever and the same thing happened and it happened i did in london i was in an english company english director proceeding the stage as opposed to an arena stage everything was different and i really thought i probably
as opposed to a child all this stuff well they get up in the morning they gotta move they gotta clean they have to organize this political this they're chasing each other they have snakes when they come home at night i mean it's all that
great that's all together now he doesn't mind he always says to me where have you been where are you going which is which is what martin says to me in life
and so we started reading and i remember the script says enters laughing and crying hysterically that was where i had to start from and they were like you know kicking it around and saying what they'd done last night and stuff like that and believe me they were talking about what they'd done last night
i tend to morsel with these two guys
you think oh i can only do one thing i only have a narrow channel and it's great when you say no i still can be flexible and morph myself into other characters say that might
and that state of mind i think is adjusted slightly because now you get kids who think they want to be in show business they don't necessarily want to be an actor and when times were very dark for me i suppose that i said
reworking but anyway so i got a call from lincoln center and from john saying would you come we're doing this little play it's just six weeks limited engagement with the mitzi newhouse
some things the best work i've ever some of the best work i've done has been a very obscure endeavors that didn't you know break through that membrane and these days especially
did work on it pretty hard and so now i'm sort of proud of the fact that these kids like rizzo so much
the first time which is pretty difficult but that's what the approach was
you know you have to be real has to be something between you which then as an actor you control because you're either on a stage or in front of lights and you have to move your head a certain way so that weird balance of control and improvisation as i mentioned
project that thing that wakes you up in the middle of the night and says oh wait a minute i know what that's about i know what that moment's about because that's really what makes it worthwhile you know that's the living part that's the being alive part
like canned beans not being able to be fresh not being able to have the enthusiasm for the next
he used to write to these different instruments and he probably did that to me and i didn't even know it but over time he said to me the second time i saw him
and that's how it came out we were having lunch and he went back that afternoon and wrote that script that made martin have his character have ms and maybe his doctor and that c that underground slot point went on for seven
because it's such a tiny part but it turned out that we did it and martin and i
and taking this real trip and the guy into the 330 of the am of the soul it's really about that and how you come back
you know you're acting in play it takes up a lot of time but it's a success but now i'm hoping that i can do more stuff on film
i think i've probably seen grease less than any other human being on the planet
late seventies when i made it he made a movie and it worked or it didn't it was a big hit at the time
i was the kid that would have to wear those long sleeve oxford
she's like most first ladies her own person i mean you wouldn't compare hillary to laura i mean i don't think they do it so why should i
you know and everything behind the scenes that goes on with it having said that um
speech does that people her friends said that i did i did judy shepherd better than judy shepherd
in the summer i think it was 1990 and then they were going to move it up to the beaumont the big theater upstage at lincoln center and it got tremendous instantly had tremendous spotlight upon it and you saw people in the audience who you knew were sitting
you weren't already a motion picture actress i would never do this i would never jeopardize my piece and fred m skepsle did the same thing and it was just an amazing leap of faith
the wider of six degrees separation but i had just finished a play by neil simon that had the dubious distinction of being the first and only to this day neil simon play to close out of town before
where there's an audience there you suddenly had a sense when the audience was responding to it that this bizarre play that seemed to be so inchoate on the page and it's so difficult to know how it was gonna communicate how to life it just touched an audience in some way in its most comedic ways and its most serious way
by the time we opened it just went through the roof and so this little thing i thought was going to be six weeks of my life ended up being four years of my life
about three months later aaron got the right idea of making me a doctor and also brought up the whole issue of the ms situation which was completely off the top of his head as far as i could tell but that's how he writes that's how he does things and then it started and that was five years ago
you know break through that membrane and these days especially it's really the luck of the draw whether you're gonna you know break through
much aware consciously aware that that was the process that was going to happen and i also was aware that he wouldn't let me off the hook
supposed to land right away because that was just an accidental thing that happened it was lovely you know so there was a great deal of comradery and just
piece that's about people who are on death row and were exonerated etc
she wanted me to be married well and raise children which is a perfectly responsible thing to do but instead i ran off and joined the circus
yes he did say that to me and it was definitely a criticism of how i was looking when i walked out the front door
long and great and terrific but i had a wonderful time doing it taught me a lot and i was working with people i became extremely close to in my life so it was extraordinary
and then back okay and then stuff that's there that said we have a what a grandchild a grandchild
because we had known each other for like 30 years and so we found this marriage building up these relationships
and it got in there by the skin of its teeth and pat birch fought for it and i think bronte and i don't know and i think the director as well i mean but it's in there and i'm so grateful that it is
i felt odd about it now i kind of love it i mean it's and i also i love her i always loved her it was more you know at that time i couldn't get interviews with people because they i was in something that some literati glitterati had you know dismantled
it is how the theater works i mean you have your rhythm of the day and
anyway there were two of us down to two of us i'm not gonna mention the other person because you'd all be stunned and amazed and think of nothing else
well that's kind of what that experience was like it was exactly what that experience was like
and i'm down stage and whoever's playing the boy is up stage you know you don't even see each other
i think i spent the entire time in the hotel room reading this damn play
can you come to san francisco and replace someone so then we went to la and da da da da da
now i doubt very much if anybody in this audience could sing choey for me but i sang it for galt mcdermott and john guare and joe papp and i think they thought it was so absurd they said oh give it to me
oh you know stuff is really going on there which i thought was definitely part of the character because she's not just you know some woman in a store buying a guy a suit
bernie jerry and bernie sat there and sort of went well my dear
you know it's not quite as clear cut as her being this monster and him the angel climbing up the stairs because he was ready to do her in
and sometimes it would take me i'd get it right away sometimes it took me a while and i said i'm not challenging you i'm really trying to figure out how to do this properly for you so it was you know it ended up i thought wonderfully i loved it but it was a whole other way of approaching something
the funnier it is we should just tell you about the sadism of comedy that's what people
dating shows crack the whip and you have three people going around and you have to add one and then you have to add one and then you have to add one until you've got twenty people
you know have a little altar up there in my brain
i made double my salary because my salary was like scale on overtime doing this thing i didn't have time to think about it i just was thrown into it and it was so
and we all sat around in living room and read it and it was hilarious it was funny but you thought oh great it's great to sit in someone's living room and read a play
the arc of it has shifted a little bit because i realized how strong
huge lovely raves from papers and then but it took us four years to get it on broadway because richard didn't want to do it and jim dale ended up doing it and it turned into a wonderful thing short lived
i once said this before so forgive me i said i felt like a cat with two big dogs
and said i mean you know we're just closing in a week and don't you guys wanna do it i was it was shameless
at the bottom i was at the bottom of the barrel bottom of a drawer maybe you know but i decided the only way i could do this was to look at her like she was just a real person and i was so much older than she was in life but i couldn't
it's wonderful arvin also memorized every word of the script we sit there in the audience and
changes i like reading things absolutely cold and that's often how i got jobs i mean i've been fortunate enough over the past million years not to have to audition
that is just a very familiar romantic comedy that's just not that interesting and it should be made by
if you've got three people on a stage and they have a relationship if you have a twohander which are really tough because everybody has to learn their lines right away to just even get near performing but at least you've got
elaine may and i did it in boston because the people with the theater company boston they knew my work and they put me in it
of precision it taught me a huge education in how you have to be patient with letting a performance evolve because the whole play was evolving it was being rewritten etc and in the end jerry and i ended up in this relationship where if you remember there's a long speech
