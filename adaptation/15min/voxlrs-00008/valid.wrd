entrepreneurs take advantage of this marketplace and utilize it in ways that we never would have dreamed i don't think i would have come up with the idea of buying and selling used cars on ebay you know as you said from beanie babies to used cars
the users are doing and then enable that we think of ourselves as a marketplace steward

so there's no question that we overpaid for autonomy because there were accounting improprieties so it's a smaller less profitable company than we were led to believe what i will say is we are very committed to the autonomy technology and to the
political favors do you think jerry brown is going to stand up to the public employee unions if they've bought and paid for his entire campaign
in la or a big company like intel every financial incentive is to go to an oregon or a nevada or a colorado then i want to streamline regulation you know i've been to now almost all 58 counties

end after a hundred days it happens to end actually on christmas day is the hundred days so i think we will end at that point but we will keep going
so i don't think we know this is all becoming you know clear what route would you take to get those deficits in line
costs and frankly the biggest problem for california is it's going to cost the state an extra three billion dollars to cover this federal health care program at a time when we simply can't afford it you know we're facing a twenty billion dollar budget deficit over the next 16 months how we're going to absorb another three billion is not at all clear so i think this is the wrong thing at the wrong time when we're in the middle of a recovery
so he has no interest in fighting it through any means and so i think he's quite happy to have this you know rain down on california
and we cannot afford that kind of tax cut right now not on top of a $20 billion budget deficit so what i want to do is get people back to work
targeted tax credits to get hiring going cut government spending and then turbocharge the economy by an acrosstheboard tax cut but you have to pace and sequence this smartly otherwise you will increase

education crime and jerry brown has refused to put out the first proposal on how he wants to fix the state you know he often says i don't like tenpoint plans right now i'd settle for one great idea on how he's going to fix california because he has no concrete plans and i don't think californians are going to put up with it
because we've got to give businesses more cash flow to invest in their business this is an incredibly difficult time for businesses like mag instruments sales are down foreign competition is up and we've got to give these
