like barely covering i would definitely vote for the longer one but you know call me crazy i'm oldfashioned
the sun just now came out so i had to you know use the shades which i'm i'm glad i decided to bring with me but it's been really cool there's a
i'd well i guess one kind of in the middle would be best because if you have a really long one with the train and everything there's like people stepping on it that's no good but i guess it kind of depends on your definition of a short dress like you know
well we definitely had a heck of a voting campaign this year especially through twitter and i don't think we really had as much of a platform to do that
you know i actually i had to watch twilight for the first time to to finally understand exactly how to act like edward so i only watched the first one i didn't i didn't continue on but a lot of it was the makeup and the hair that kind of really put it all together you know
well it's it's been really cool and hot is a word to describe how i'm feeling right now
it was my first time wearing guide liner which was really weird for me i found out i have this horrible reflex where as long as there's like a pencil right next to my eyes my head goes like this
basically the thank you i i honestly i i struggled a lot with it this year because i didn't want to do the same thing over and over and over again but heck i like them
farther and farther back and my makeup lady was getting so frustrated she was like hold your head still
i think the one with mrs obama was probably the most meaningful to me because i'm i'm very interested in the military so being able to do something that was kind of a direct thank you to our to our families in the armed forces i think was one of the coolest things we could do
that's the only thing that i was thinking maybe like the slime would have to be tested first or or something but yeah i certainly hope that they're able to pull that out
unreal experience ever just going up there on stage and and how loud it was and how much energy everybody had was
absolutely i would i would definitely hope so but i mean we have some really stiff competition this year so and now we're nominated against victoria so we got our sister show to compete with you know i don't know i'm i'm hoping that we can make it you know three is a three pete i don't know if there's a special term for four but hopefully it'll be four whatever that is
just my memories from the very first kids' choice awards after icarly had aired so people actually knew who we were that was that was just really
surreal you know the the fact that that many people cared and that many people were fans definitely our first win was probably the most
so you know having having all these awesome people as part of the show is really
i think my favorite thing is whoever they get to host every year because it's always somebody huge and and having will smith as a host is going to be amazing and we have some awesome performers we have one direction and katy perry who are two of the biggest groups out there
narrow it down one moment we were moving around so much that it was
the first time we the night before when we first got to san diego before comic con we introduced a couple of fan screenings for the movie so people got to see it for the first time the next day at comic con we did a forum that was headed by zachary levi for for his foundation
just as a general note comic con was absolutely nuts it was everything that i believed would be described to me and more the costumes were insane
from their fans yeah so they i had been a fan of it for a while and i tweeted about it during the second season and they saw it got in touch with me and asked if they could write me into to the last season as a new villain character that they were thinking about
so props to them but it was cool because that's that'ts kind of the genre that i want to get myself into so it was really good practice in a very friendly environment of kind of the the place that i want to end up so that will be coming out in
wrapped up a a web series that i had been a fan of for a while called
so it not only did they have to do it once they had to do it twice completely out of their environment the second time and i think that is a feat
phenomenally intense and emotional scene without being in the water just standing in front of a microphone it's it's hard enough trying to match your words just in a scene saying stuff but to have that emotion too
and i we went in and did a chemistry read because actually i i auditioned for max's part i think most of the younger guys actually probably did
yeah it was it was very cool it's very stunt heavy and i got to look awesome and and they edited it together where i'm actually way more talented at it than i actually
i genuinely don't think that i could do that that took a phenomenal amount of skill and both of these guys had to do it for the entire scene and you would never know
a web series that has gotten phenomenally popular on the internet they have crowdfunded every single season they've done so far and their season 3 raised almost a million
yes i'm also a licensed driver so that may have had something to do with well
so she thought it would be disgusting like some kind of concoction or brew or nastiness and it basically just tastes like
you know lemon lime soda so it was good but yeah that was really fun getting to hang out with you guys because normally we just hang out i like promo
stuff like that where you know now we're in like a professional working environment so it's kind of cool to see that little aspect of it and i got to ride a segway type vehicle which was cool and i never wanted to get off of it you
oh yeah you were puking all over the place and then i got her ginger ale and it made it all better but she didn't want to drink it i know you did not want to drink the ginger
i just did an episode of csi and it aired march 11th it was really fun i got to see the rough cut of it before it actually ended up on tv and i'm not gonna lie it was actually really lame because there was no like sound effects or music or special effects or anything so it was really like a a skeleton thing and when i saw it i was like is that really how it's gonna
which is like me walking all over the place and like introducing kids to the paparazzi it's gonna be like rock band
your status stuff where it's like i got to sleep in till 7 30 this morning i'm serious
i don't know what i'm gonna do for my senior year i think i think i'm gonna take like
hard classes ever so that i can just kind of like have fun my senior year and not you know maybe have a little bit of a social life that would be nice and so yeah we're gonna be working all through the summer
or hear the voice of d bradley breaker baker who are all really great people and it's just
this whole movie follows the perspective of several different angles as we start out it opens on this this collection of time capsule videos being recorded for the town of silverton to be open 25 years later and as we progress we see who it's being shot by donnie and trey and
