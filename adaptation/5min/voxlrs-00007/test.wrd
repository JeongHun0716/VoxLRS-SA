the starting point for a first home buyer is to get a good job that pays good money
and and malcolm turnbull suggested a 100000 dollars guarantee so that is another example but look
apocalyptic scenario in the parliament in february saying there's a cyclone ripping through the world creating damage wreaking havoc on families and that was a justification for the second stimulus package and you see the prime minister is hellbent on a political strategy his political strategy is in a year and a half he wants to say hang on guys
he said that we're being hit by a cyclone on a number of occasions and this
let me explain this it's a pretty simple equation with the prime minister if you are in any way critical of his government
well i think it's probably too late and that's because a lot of families out there would have already committed to some form of spending or saving on the basis of the passage of the legislation
it's not my fault it's the fault of the rest of the world and in the in the process of doing that he's causing untold damage to the australian economy with his apocalyptic rhetoric and the fact that he is constantly talking everything down
well clearly unemployment is rising but kevin rudd and wayne swan are making it worse because they're rhetoric
end of the reforms then explain to me why a government would not accept the man unanimous mandate of the senate and just get on with the job
work choices died at 230am this morning with a unanimous vote of the senate every party labor liberal national greens 2 independents all unanimously voted to kill work choices at 230 this
david the september quarter nonfarm gdp last year was negative
you're asking us to give rolling numbers the government can't even get its numbers right so we have to work off their numbers we will give you full box and dice before the next election
6 billion so whilst all these numbers are deteriorating at their own hand and whilst we have europe heading into recession the united states anemic and china with slowing growth the government somehow expects everyone to believe that they'll deliver a surplus next year i think they need to tell the truth they can't claim the credibility
hundreds and hundreds of public servants wayne swan is unable to deliver a surplus we will do it because we are prepared to make hard decisions about reducing government expenditure and you will see our plans before the election
i have no complaint about that but wayne swan was just on radio saying that
no actually sorry virginia if you actually look at my interview with
the chopping block what i've said is we've got to reduce the public service and we'll do it through natural attrition over over two years
well because they're still spending money i'll just come back they're still spending money
said is we will reduce the public service by over 12000 if we are elected because the public service has increased by more than 20000 since labor was elected
giving the government an excuse the government gives itself an excuse the bottom line is they are spending like drunken sailors handing out checks for 900 dollars was dead wrong and it had a true impact on the budget because ultimately everyone's going to have to pay for it
are out there playing a song and you know ultimately everyone has to start to hold them accountable because ultimately everyone's going to have to pay the taxes
shift from individuals and from the federal government to the state governments because they're going to
is about raising money and the fact that kevin rudd gave everyone 900 dollars or most people 900 dollars sooner or later will come home to roost they'll have these tax increases medicare rebate cuts
the sort of thing that labor does and why is it under labor that we always end up with bigger debts and higher tax
i want to believe it i want to believe that it's true i really hope that it's true i really hope that it
well this is another broken promise from kevin rudd and it also significantly virginia
what is consistent we have consistently said that this government is spending too much money we have consistently said that this government is going to have to increase taxes and charges to try and pay for it now they're doing it and you know what ultimately we there needs to be proper scrutiny on this mob they're paying they're playing the media
embarrassed about the amount of debt that they are building up they didn't have the courage to say it in the speech last night they didn't have the courage to say it at a press conference last night
you know i'm very reasonable about that i accept that they're very difficult times the question is how you react and this government in very difficult times has gone on the biggest spending spree in modern australian history
kevin rudd is trying to verbal me and you know that's what kevin rudd does get get you know tries to divert attention from his own failings making allegations about others what i pointed out was when the labor party announced a 42 billion dollars package earlier
and they haven't got the courage to deal with it in the budget itself you know this is this is a ball and chain around the legs of every australian they are leaving every australian as of today with a debt of nine thousand dollars each and you know what natasha it will get worse because you can't believe that this mob will control their spend
and you know why because they're handing it out as cash in fact the total amount of cash that the government has handed out is about the same as what they say is the cornerstone of this budget 22 billion dollars on infrastructure the irony is that of their so called nation building infrastructure
as i said yesterday the hyperventilation and what is now hypocrisy is just getting a bit rich in relation to peter slippy
who made a massive contribution to the welfare of the community
that they seem to initiate on regular occasions in relation to parliamentary discourse
