extraordinary what he achieved i mean he would go off into the jungles on these expeditions for two or three years at a time and where other men had attempted to to map and to to explore and never came back you know and
i mean i suppose you know it was very strenuous some of these locations we were going to and like i said we were losing weight so i was on very very little calories so i would get pretty fatigued sometimes
you know a little emotional sometimes frankly you know when you're starving yourself like that you know i find myself on a real emotional roller coaster sometimes i was sort of manically happy and energetic and sometimes i just had no energy and wanted to cry so just trying to stay as emotionally
i'm a little bit subsequently and obviously going to really like him he's a lovely guy
yeah i mean you know tom was the relationship with him my approach to working with him was sort of very gentle and nurturing and you know sort of i guess as fatherly as he would accept me being i mean we're not that far apart in age and yet here i was playing as father
a remarkable man and the more i got to know him through the research i was doing the more i fell in love with him and felt like a great sense of responsibility to bring him to get to the screen as honest
at least from our perception of who he was as honestly and as complexly as we could
i i'm sure you would like the idea of it is scary and you know there were certainly people that have
it was immediately apparent from reading the script the the requirements of this and not really the physical requirements didn't bother me at all it was the
enjoying as much success as he is right now i had a really great time with him and yeah he's a he's a phenomenal
obviously thrashing about trying to get back out and then he couldn't so he went to the next course of action which
the way to get something lodged in your ear like that is with a very powerful jet of water so bless the little
significant undertaking and then when i got into deeply researching the character just a sense of responsibility to the man i fell in love with him and was so in awe of what he'd done in his life
was something that you know i was nervous about and required an enormous amount of thought to figure out how to do that effectively but it was more the emotional
i am with you i knew nothing about him i'd never heard of fawcett which was sort of criminal being british and he's such an important part of british culture but i actually think that very few people know about him so i'm really grateful that we had the opportunity to tell a story in this film but yeah i mean like you said it was
it was going to require more for from me than i'd ever had to give
total gentleman you know because they don't you know there's not very much to prove and when you are a rough guy in a rough world there's
real repercussions to your actions you better think really carefully before you before you speak and before you act
gender to get that film into production as soon as possible and i was already booked up for
it's an origin if they want to play around with the origin of the motorcycle culture in america so
necessity to reinvent it leaves a lot of room for us to imbue
reimagining it and doing something fresh because obviously it's a story that's been told many times before and we had to
had to convince him that that would be a grave mistake on his part so so yeah i
competitive business and life's tough so you gotta fight for what you want go on ask me one more question
i really just demanded that he have a cup of tea with me so that we could get to know each other as chaps and i still honestly i didn't think he was going to give me the role because he didn't seem like a man who was particular
one night and i threatened there would be burglar with a machete
we're all on the same journey so you know that that's the that's the fundamental thing is that you have to try to make it as personal as possible
saturation i'd literally seen it 50 times and so i gave it a spin
no in fact in real life i've i've had to defend myself once before with a machete but thankfully i didn't actually have to hit the chap with it i got
things that are important to me as an actor hopefully will be relevant to you as an audience goer because
narratives and themes are accessible to or relatable to a younger generation
i don't think he had specifically an actor in mind who he wanted to hire i just think he was
it did i mean yeah there was there was a lot of physical requirement both in getting myself into the appropriate shape you know doing a lot of pushups and pullups and that sort of melod
something that you know something a bit different than than than the way sword fighting never been handled before but it was uncertain what that was so we did many many versions and each version required me to do an enormous amount of preparation so every time we'd shoot a scene it'd be like
i do literally nothing would make me happier than to come back and do another one of these films i think guy feels the same way but you know we only tell the first chapter of the story
the years between about six and eight i must have watched it 50 times and so i was very familiar with the arthurian legends and then my team
it did and just from the one line pitch that i heard of guy ritchie's king arthur i saw i saw what i thought that was going to be and was very excited but
i learned all of that from aidan and it always felt like a very grand debt of gratitude to him so i was excited to work with him again
since my late teens an enormous fan of guy ritchie's when i heard that he was doing this i just immediately intuited what that would be i could sort of see the vision for what guy would do and i thought it was quite exciting so i just i just went about pursuing pursuing guy and and seeing if i could get myself involved
