one is having a mentor one is having a coach surrounding yourself with those people
staying active in any way shape or form is always going to be better for you
continually try to reach perfection rather than embracing differences and especially with young children i found that so important in high school when i attended high school i saw that more and more that there are teenage boys and girls that simply do not understand differences
to hide away ignore and not address and when we have boys and girls teenage boys and girls dying every day because of eating disorders that are 100
where that would be possible after i won miss america my grandma
where my grandpa grew up and he was explaining to us that when the communist soldiers came through drafting young men on the island into the army there was a large fireplace
and a national staff so donald trump has no hand in it he's actually tried to buy the organization a couple of years but we continually tell him not for profits or not for sale and he has no hand in it
she was not able to find out where he went and she had no idea where he was
and that time was so critical for me you know i loved school
it was something i never thought i would enjoy that's for sure i was very shy as a child and as i said my mother homeschooled the six of us
and that's pretty much all you can handle as a preschooler and then when you graduated you would graduate to
it was so scary to jump into a public school for the first time in my life but i knew it was something that i could do
that would signal that it was their turn to come to america a place that they did not have to be afraid of the dictator
was constantly on her mind and in her heart but through the age of
that timing happened i thought i was skipping a year of high school so i could graduate law school early and not be in school until i was 24 obviously that's now going to happen but there was something else in the plan that i didn't see that i didn't know about
those assignments and we had to find out these certain bits of information from our relatives so we went all over the island interviewing lost relatives and people we didn't know people we did know
those things i didn't find that i didn't dedicate myself to any one thing i had my friends that were planning on going on to be concert pianists or professional dancers but i knew i was
purpose and so you know like i said it's been incredible to realize that there is a purpose and a reason and a meaning to everything that i've done
because of the country that we have and because of the freedoms we have and that has taught me so much about making the most of it
i found it was a place that i could excel for years i had been searching for that
i am clay in your hands your humble servant willing to do whatever you wish for me in your per
especially at this time that my generation is in i feel like many people are searching for role models for examples for hope for inspiration
thing i was hoping to address is one of the main reasons i am also doing this
area going to school so i certainly hope to be even more involved in the race there as well
really feel comfortable in being by myself and alone with god and not always meeting people around me and sometimes that's difficult to survive without that support group without your inner circle but it's something that really made
back home and driving through scottsbluff and gearing again it feels like nothing ever changed and so it's hard to remember
just falling apart and very strongly contemplating jumping off the top
any reality show any competition whatever it may be many of them use it in the same way and i don't think that that is any
well you know honestly in my perspective for me personally
i think that any industry any area of life any job can potentially objectify women it depends on if you allow it to
only see positives and i didn't see how it was going to hinder me because as ms nebraska i traveled by myself and i wasn't old enough to stay in hotel rooms by myself so i had to stay with
you see that you can't go into an airport and yell bomb you can't go into a movie theater and yell fire that's free speech yes but sometimes it comes to a point of security and that's where that line is drawn and so we have to be very careful with that but we must draw the line somewhere
guitar other things and once you start playing piano other forms of music come a lot easier
they have a new one every year we actually every former miss america gets to keep her crown so i still have mine and i think it's
but to understand that that is where the only rights in federal government lie it's not that the constitution leaves us powerless it leaves the federal government a lot less powerless than the people and i think that's something that no matter what issue it may be we need to find does the constitution have anything to say about it
with them so when i got to the high school i realized that my friends were from very different walks of life very different cliques
and now looking back of course i realize how had i not done that i would not be
you know and going into the school was just interesting to me to find they were all in these groups that didn't interact with each other and so people would ask well why are you friends with that person are you friends with that one and i said you know we have these common interests in these bonding similar passions and it doesn't matter that we're in different groups
it's cool to have bragging rights to their friends but other than that it's it's nothing to them they actually begged not to come to the miss america pageant because they would rather stay home and play video
any positions that we're taking when it comes to federal issues need to have constitutional backing and we need to see how that relates otherwise it needs to go down to the
