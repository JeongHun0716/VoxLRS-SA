my hats usually because i don't have a haircut that i've chosen myself or hair style
i mean the list is endless for me i mean at the moment and people who were kind of i think very
it's been amazing similar to these guys it's truly a dream come true all i can say is i'm very thankful for the opportunity to play or have the experience of something like that it's been truly a whirlwind and i'm very excited yet very nervous about it coming out it's a dream an absolute dream
the fact that he basically used to poison so many people but then he had to antidote and the antidote didn't
i wish there was something like this that was accessible to me as a child if you know what i mean because i think it would have helped me understand
i think in a positive way it's bizarre to say thanks for crying
there was a lot of things that i needed to research actually going into it and one was how to
and then also the fact that we had an amazing director but
you can tell when someone plays an instrument you can tell just from what they do with their fingers or how they pass the time
physical life of a character before i find the sort of emotional or mental
it turns up to set every day with loads of ideas of how we could do this and how we could do that and yeah it was a true pleasure to work with her i hope i get the chance to do it again
being familiar with the source material and you know being restricted in that sense but speaking to people along the way i'd realised quickly that everyone who goes through something like this you know has
sort of laugh with jokes we had that i had no idea about especially being english i was like i don't know what you're talking about but i'm not going to laugh with you i'm going to try but no like i said they were veryâ€¦
i did i actually played snake quite a lot i have to say honestly it took me back to science class at school i just sit at the back
i don't know and there's also the obviously the obvious which is a live audience and you feed from the audience and you find new things during during
welcomed i guess change and wanted to make it the best film possible so often would ask my opinion on directing moments you know when i spent so much time behind the camera he said you know what's an easier way we can make this work
being in a horror movie and watching a horror movie three very very different steps along the way of something that's very very very tricky
and you know in a sense what i think attracted me to this was that it had a lot of similarities in the sense that it was told from pov at times and it was about something that you didn't see all the time or barely at all and
you know what i mean it's one of those faces that every time you see someone being scared it's quite a kind of funny right so running through like the woods for example turning around and seeing someone else going
the previous three films have been building up to so you need to give the fans what they want you know
a lot more to fight for and they want the future to be the best it can be and therefore yeah
it was very close to home for me and it was the first time i'd ever done anything contemporary
for the snow white and the one that i was in so it was we should have met so many times along the years but for some reason fate brought us together at this very fine moment
one hell of a pressure to kind of make people
where do i start no i think i think the moment me and lily met there was an immediate bond and immediate chemistry like a connection we have a lot of mutual friends and connections within the industry and we realized that we both auditioned for each other's snow white
so i spent a lot of my time doing musicals and i think she knew that i was a bit of a drama queen even when i played football i probably spent most of the game crying
that i was their finnick or worthy of finnick and everyone had a very very different preconceived idea as to who should play that part but everyone had a very
we decided we're going to go for a take so i was like yeah fantastic
through one accident loses everything and i think that to me is an interesting
it's mayhem but you know such a privilege to be here
it's an epic story it's also the next installment of an already well established film and i genuinely believe that it's going to get people talking
really enjoy francis's vision i mean it's kind of keeping
that moment and then when we kind of eventually got there i think we were so nervous and like
game the amount of time i think there was something really wrong with me and jennifer that we were
or it's fine but yeah i did that and that was very exciting
i've tried my hand at writing a script and i found it
were incredibly great scenes i then realised i didn't know what was going to happen after that or what happened before that or i think structurally to have the gift of being able to structure something
i kind of tried to use that to channel into how will would be feeling but it's impossible to really understand the full struggle and challenges that someone in a wheelchair lives with every day but i just try to do my best
an inspiration it inspires a nation to come together and sort of
enjoying it and experiencing it through our eyes with us
to base camp or where the set was and he was just chatting and i was like this is i feel really comfortable in here i'm welcomed you know it's such a beautiful place and you have the best of everything here i think the best guinness the best views it's a really wonderful place
room together and kind of put us nose to nose and told us to like talk to each other it was very intense but then after that we
know creating an alliance well he's very keen to obviously from the beginning but yeah i mean i think he's a very sensitive soul and i think a lot of people can take away from him
so having the opportunity to work with her at last is
