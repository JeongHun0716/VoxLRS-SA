i watched silent films of the time that the producers kind of put on my lap on my lap
what what's become very apparent is so many people have their own opinions on things and we've thought
it's a different world and it's a world that i can't fully relate to and i never will be able to relate to so as an actor you kind of have to
very sort of yeah it's a it's a great feeling really really happy to be here it's my first time here as well so it's an opportunity to kind of see a new place
for you know well fortunately nothing has been that tragic in my life at the same time i think
bringing the world together in whatever capacity and people are having their voices heard now more than ever i mean my character's job in the in in the film is is is is is to kind of galvanize those people to make them realize that that you know they are worthy and
which was something again that that that kind of threw me out of my comfort zone and i knew that this would be challenging in its own way it was a sort of a unique way it's a unique
sort of powered whilst a lot of men were away fighting and kind of serving the country in that way it's it's about a young woman who serves her country becoming a writer for for the people
witnessed and and watched and and read about you know every single man that lived through that time i definitely
bad things happening and i i think it's sort of a an uplifting
he and i have kind of nearly worked together a few times
i mean the very first time we we meet will we see him a small
just wanting to comfort someone and not being able to i think but trying to soothe them with only your voice is the only sort of tool that he has the only
understandably he's in a he's in a very very dark place and so when will first is introduced to lou you kind of imagine that he's had the best care the best
however many hours of the day was a lot more challenging than i i once thought it would
been incredibly challenging and i think i think actually during the audition process i that was when i was first sort of in
who he is and who he was before the accident
talk openly and talk honestly to someone who's disabled purely because they kind of see
good time as well as working hard and i think we have the same mentality when it comes to work is that we want to have fun but at the same time we want to make a good
thing that he has going for him and the fact that will you know will will's brain is very very very much still functioning the way it always has and he's very very bright
because i can safely say that you know it's quite inspiring there are so many inspiring stories but there's so many hard
two of them together there there there's she's the first person who speaks her mind i think so many people are afraid
boyfriend especially i'd be like oh do you wanna you know we should totally be friends oh my god we should write letters
i was a comforter i was a comforter and it worked never it never actually
continued talking to my friends who i could have just stayed and walked home a bit slower and we could have had an actual conversation but there was something so unique and new about using the internet back then
and then and then once the boyfriend split up i'll be like you want to cry
in love by beyonce and we were like has this brought out like ten years ago
i'm sort of proud of him really it it it was it was a real
but i think that's a really an amazing creative choice that what we kind of decided to do
i obviously had to learn about all of that and to kind of explore that and to sort of teach myself as best i can what it was that will hides from the world and what he hides from the audience what we hide from the audience you don't see him really suffering
do you know what i knew amelia a little bit before we started filming a very very small amount so it was kind of nice to get to know her properly
delve deeper into a world that i wasn't that familiar with you know i hadn't met someone in a wheelchair really properly in my life
and just left a pile of papers and then she put fish in my socks
dressed the way that she was dressed it was very difficult to kind of maintain that focus and very very grumpy demeanors
decided it would be funny to kind of pretend that i kidnapped it it was a a long story but i then did kidnap it and then i stole all of her furniture out of her dressing room
yes i mean i'd like to think i was sort of aware of that prior to this story at the same time this definitely opened my eyes wider and really allowed me to kind of
like a willing and wanting kind of need desire to kind of learn more and so i watched documentaries after documentaries there's an incredible one with terry pratchett just before he passed away where he kind of followed the lives of three people going to the test
to embrace their new life but then some people can they embrace it and it can be a positive
it's it's a lot of the times i was very very surprised by how people react and and yeah it's been a real life
even when i read the script for the first time i then sort of searched what it meant i think the first time it was mentioned in the script
followed their journeys i think what what became very very clear to me is you know we're obviously telling the story of will trainor but everyone has a different story and some people really
if you know what i mean and therefore i wanted to lose a lot of muscle mass and i wanted to lose a lot of my kind of
not that i thought it would be easy but i think naively i didn't think it would be as much of a struggle as it was but honestly you know i i was pretty much tensing the entire time i was in the chair so as you can imagine for many many hours of a day that
that can be quite physically draining but i there was a lot of training involved for me through a choice of mind
injuries as well what was clear to me was when you were in that sort of state
and his decision making and kind of getting on board with that
so many people up to that point looked at him and seen the wheelchair and not the person sitting in it and i think she's not she's not afraid of telling him that he's being a nasty person when he's being a nasty person and giving as good as he gets as she gets
so i play will trainor who is a man who appears to have everything when we first meet him
