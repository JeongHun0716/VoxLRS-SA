the reality is that those investments that i am talking about those investments
mr speaker it's been it's been a long summer let's just go over what has been happening
our investments in the people of this province i know that the i know that the member opposite may not be aware but this morning the minister of education and i announced a program called experience ontario 600 young people across ontario
i know that there are still people in this province who are struggling to find a job i understand that mr speaker that's why we are making the investments
i know that the economy is fragile i know that we are working in a context of a global economy that is fragile but we are putting in 
after high school mr speaker to help them to decide where they might go whether they'll go to postsecondary or training or into a job is just
it takes a lot of energy and a lot of organizing to put your name on a ballot to win a leadership and to get here to take a seat so congratulations on that
to add to that that one of the things i heard in the round table was very much that students want to be involved in the formation of those policies and so
ontario and you know it really changed the way i think about the way our society works
somebody said the other day that it's the best time of your life it's a hard time of life as well because
yeah that's a great question i i i have felt very much in the
international women's day so march 8th and part of that will be how are we going to make sure that there are the right policies in place on college and university campuses queen's has done a lot of work
that's something that i that was a very important takeaway for me it made perfect sense to me and
young people they're under a lot of pressure so whether that's whether that's mental health or whether that's career
human interaction and it led to my master studies which was
its uniform across the across the province and we'll be making that announcement at the beginning of march
i mean i think you just look at what i've said about making investments in infrastructure making sure that we have a strong publicly funded education system that we have a new vision for education like i i've been pretty clear about where i think we need to go i've said i'm not going to cut in slash i've said we need to make investments
debate if you want a window on internal discussion what is that line when does
a lot of kind of prefabricated back and forth that is is a sort of person
think vicious attack does work i think that it turns people off and i think one of the reasons that we have a large segment of the population particularly young people is that they hear
you know the fact is i see politics differently i see our path forward differently than tim hudak and andrea horvath do i'm concerned at some of the stuff that tim hudak's talking about because i think he's going to pick a fight with labour with teachers i think he's
he's dangerous i don't know what andrea horvath stands for i think that she's been very unclear on some issues that i would have thought the ndp would have been clear on same
it's not for me as the premier to decide who represents
negative advertising i really don't like it and so what i've said to people is we have to contrast you know we have to demonstrate how we're different from the conservatives and from the ndp but i i am not interested in attacking human beings you know i'm not interested in attacking
think vicious attack does work i think that it turns people off and i think one of the reasons that we have a large segment of the population particularly young people is that they
look at what i've said about making investments in infrastructure making sure that we have a strong publicly funded education system that we have a new vision for education like i i've been pretty clear about where i think we need to go i've said i'm not going to cut and slash i've said we need to make investments and i've i've taken the federal government to task for example for not partnering with us on on making those investments
well prepared for that i mean every every time we've made a leap and i say we there's been homophobia that's come up and we've had to deal with it as a as a couple and she to be fair she was out a long time before i was you know and she dealt with in the corporate in her corporate life she dealt with it in
as the trust of the council and the people of the city right so right now council
and you're talking about politics and how important it is that people care
he's dangerous i don't know what andrea horvath stands for i think that she's been very unclear on some issues that i would have thought the ndp would have been clear on
very clear about our plan we have brought a plan to the people of the province we introduced a budget last week that laid out a plan for investment in talent
that it would have been a very good idea to have worked to find a willing host like napanese
very important question and i think what it what it points to is that
the the population has grown so much i used to drive you know my family would drive from
towards that balanced budget at the same time we need to keep our schools strong keep our health
the the jobs and that's i think that's going to become more of a problem if you look at mining the mining 
and they are talking about moving up the plan to
because right now we have an economy that has jobs that are available but we have a labor force a workforce that does
school boards everyone from the education sector and we will work together to develop a new way of bargain
authority okay it's the group that has a plan for transit all over
be in trouble because he saw what was happening in the auto industry so we actually started
full range of human issues get dealt with you know what we know is if there are more women in politics then
and working with business to find opportunities for young people in a systematic way to have
investing early and that meant there were jobs that meant people were working and we kept the economy going so we have done better and we we should be very proud of that and there's still more to do
their goods around and have solid environments to work in the other thing that 
i i just want to add that i'm very aware whenever i
