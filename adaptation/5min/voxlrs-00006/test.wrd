he never never wanted to have canned beans you know he's got the fresh
pace you have to edit yourself you have to know where they're where they're where they're looking where they're not looking you have to have that double thing going on which is a real juggling act and has its own anxiety to it which is rather stimulating
it's not that you think that the laughter of the audience so much is that silences when you're doing even a
of every man tommy lee was every man and i heard heard him sing amazing grace on that stage and i was in a wheelchair playing good deeds and i did midsummer night's dream with like puck and we did trojan women
i think jimmy played paris you know but it was all very wild and
i don't like that sense of separation people have between i think in our country one of the problems is we're so big that it's really
kind of challenge and so that you're constantly made fresh
summer theater we did i mean i did like 35 plays in various venues
you say oh i licked i that that was bothering me that's oh i know what that means now and i mean i had
i suppose my first big break was actually in too jail in the verona which was then a musical adaptation that john guare had written
of his you know rummy mitchens in in major barbara we're not all talking
and that's about that time i got in a television movie called girl most likely to that joan rivers wrote which was quite popular
and i went up to him and i got scrambled out of this van and i said hi we've actually never met but i think we've been married for about 50 years
with and he obviously made this choice i'm gonna miss him he's a good guy and he's a terrific actor and i
weird to sit there you know and so
it was called a state dinner and they decided he should have a wife it was early on in the first season and they negotiated with my agent i was up in canada doing a movie and i had a couple of days off so they they literally the night before said it's going to work and i was literally going hiking
because i didn't have any you know it's funny with with television because you know with movies they they have campaigns they take out ads and stuff like that and people talk about it a lot like who may get nominated who may not and stuff but i think with emmy nominations it sort of one day it happens and i you know so you never know what people are seeing
this is to who calls me at five o'clock in the morning and i sort of when i know it's that day i said wake up at 430
he said yeah we got we got girls and then a grandchild i said grandchild
at the end of september in los angeles it's unbelievably hot and uncomfortable that there you are getting dressed like
happened and i certainly was amazed when i got to i was so gratified about the matthew shepard story
just the way the climate was so none of this really made any
step by you know it's just a movie it's just some success and you could go away tomorrow and then you have to figure out that
such a big hit but you know all the people who made studio movies were very snobby about it
sent me out to the studio and the hairdresser who was doing the test was it was her weekend so she sent her
i was and i have to say at the beginning it wasn't working out terribly well you know so for a while i didn't make any money and and then i got a my first big break was in a movie called the fortune for mike nichols
what is it for and they said the west wing and i i said oh i saw that show it's great and i had no idea what i was going to be doing i had no idea what the character
and it ended up in la and they both threw me into an evening gown and i i got on this
and then the second about a couple months later we've gone in the air and and then there are a lot of people writing in and stuff that did very well my episode so i had lunch with aaron and i said so what do we do now
i think maybe i think maybe you should be a doctor i said okay and that was how it worked
you know in those days at least which is a very long time ago people i don't know it didn't seem so
and i turn on television set and there was this show starting up the west wing yeah yeah and i stopped unpacking i stopped eating i started watching this thing and i said wow is this good this will never last
we did that this this spring summer and that's on showtime this saturday night so since i did on the west wing i've been able to do
i was in canada last september and i was working up there and you know when you move into a new place you order room service
bus to go to the set and there is martin sheen and white tie we've never met each other before in our lives we had no chance to rehearse or anything i had no idea who else was to be playing and i said i knew it was a great show and i went up to when i said you know hi hi i'm sockert i'm martin we embraced it i think we've been married about this
this is a true story i'm not going to make up anything i i couldn't possibly do that i have a friend
it was as much a surprise to them as it was to my friend i mean everybody was in this together you know they may have felt better right after
and there was a bus boy who was they were breaking in it was like his first day and the reason i knew his first day
but i i don't think i think it depends on the dog i have a dog a very large dog who was sleeping at the foot of my bed at the time and as a matter of fact i i was dreaming and i woke up and i yelled at my dog
i did it till i could get it right and then they say well give her the part in the movie which is pretty unusual so i i guess
but there they are and so at 4 30 in the morning julie wakes up and she realizes after the earthquake that every one of her 11 dogs in the house
i mean it's a tossup i mean after all i think that the cold you at least you get away from it it's happened you can bundle up unless you're caught in the street that is horrible but you know i think the worst thing about the earthquake is it happened once and now we hear that that could be just a dress rehearsal you know and it could just happen again this could have been like a runthrough there's nothing yeah
breakthrough it's great but then that was that was two years passed between that moment that conversation and when we were in actual rehearsal so there were you know i was waiting for the phone call for them to say i don't know how to tell you this but you know the script's great the money's there but there's just one little thing they want you know to play the part
well yeah up and down up and up then it goes down then it goes sideways and then whatever you know like that
is really what it's about it's about kind of it's like emotional bungee jumping and it's sort of a sort of a two character piece and then and a young man a younger man is involved and i figured you know i got a couple of years left in me to
