i'm not here to make any announcements about the nba the nbl allstar game but i'm certainly willing to take that on board
local communities but also working with government working with the private sector you know sport's such an important
opportunity in basketball to do the kind of things i like doing in politics you know working with people
for us to look at bringing whether it's a n the nbl all stars or other types of special event matches to wollongong it's a great venue for that
i know our fans were disappointed last year with the tv deal and so were we and that's why we went back to channel 10 and renegotiated next year every sunday afternoon a a live game on channel 10 free to air and then on friday nights on
love of mine and so to bring that all together in one job well i'm a very lucky person
that anna bly's good friend kevin rudd decided to launch a leadership challenge right in the middle of this campaign it made it incredibly hard for anna
but let's look at let's look at the queensland result lots of people trying to draw analogies about what it means federally anably's labour government started to become unpopular about three months after its election when
there's a different story happening federally where we have seen a bit of quite a bit of volatility the prime minister and the labour party closing that gap on two party preferred and indeed she is ahead
wink and one sign give me have you seen the protest this week have you seen the protest this week those very same signs were there and a wink and a nod and clive palmer they're all out there giving approval to the
from that i think what we had there was a situation we have kevin rudd decided on his own bat and arbitrarily to launch a very nasty bid for the leadership and totally poisoned the waters there in queensland for anna blige
see this on the first of july when the world doesn't fall in just as it didn't fall in with the gsa
she is the preferred prime minister she's ahead of tony abbott there
hard environment for anybody whether it's julia or anna or wayne swan or anyone to carry
when i spoke to a journalist about the wine i forgot then but i'm now remembered and i've updated my pec
i suppose the question i have is maybe he didn't want to survive in office
minister's office minister kelly's office it suddenly became a solicited proposal and that is a powerful change it is a it
in that evaluation found that the proposal lacked any merit lacked any value for money for the taxpayer and recommended in a draft minute that the proposal be reject
you'd have to think if he'd done that he might have suffered a day or two of embarrassment but he would have survived in office
and ostensibly it was about something else i can't even remember but he raised the issue of australian water holdings that this was this company that was achieving good value for the taxpayer and its proposals were being frustrated by government and we should have a look at the proposal a look at it on its merits he argued
the good news is that with one candidate named keneally and the other named o'farrell the clear winner on the 26th of march will be the irish so ladies and gentlemen
remarkably what i think is most remarkable is tony and barry are wearing the same outfit
on st patrick's day as does having an accent that occasionally makes me sound
acknowledge the consul general of ireland and also to acknowledge minister francis fitzgerald for thank you for joining us here in australia for these celebrations well it is terrific to be back here at the landsdowne club i'm sitting there at a table with my political opponent with julie's politic political opponent
and last from kilkenny but it does help me get into parties like this one and it's for many reasons that i do feel at home here today
peace has broken out st patrick is performing miracles still yet again 1700 years later and
who told the irish echo that his irish background has given him an interest in social justice together with a capacity to talk to the limits of verbosity yeah that's true a facility with language and a tendency to tease and stir and as only tom can
on that note have a wonderful st patrick's day and i look forward to a wonderful lunch today slainte

that coal mine seems to be very close to approval by the new south wales liberal government major
we're joined tonight by acting greens leader scott ludlam on a day that has been full of news about clean energy finance wind turbines and coal mines and
and then patiently explained to me the concept of risk and reward hence the
was bloodletting the cefc as the government wasn't able to kill it off outright in the senate now as i understand it this directive does
finance corporation because the government did seem to kick off clean energy week by declaring and directing
statutory body with an independent board are there any avenues open to the senate here
the prime minister have a point that those things that can operate without a subsidy
is that they should lower their risk profile but increase their profits now if i said that to my financial
have to come back to the government the cefc gets the chance to comment on it then it comes back to the government and they need to table it in the parliament for it to become legally binding will the senate stand by and watch while the government tries to interfere in the
one member of the abbott government who doesn't like open cut coal mines or at
elected politicians should be exercising some caution as people are taking themselves what is really into harm's way as they're protest
this interview and that's exercise talisman sabra i don't know who names these things but last week you expressed concern about this threeway joint training exercise with the us
