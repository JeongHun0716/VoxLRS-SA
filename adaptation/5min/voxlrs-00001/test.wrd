the last few days to assess whether or not boris could lead that team and build that unity and i came as i say reluctantly but firmly to
leading the conservative party and the country at the moment someone with experience at the highest reaches of government we need someone who believes in the british people's verdict that they delivered
that as someone who had argued from the beginning that we should leave the european union and as someone who wanted to ensure that a bold positive vision for our future was implemented
last week we need someone who can appeal to and unite individuals who argued that we should leave and who also believed that we should remain in the european union and already today i've had support from colleagues across that spectrum and indeed from outside politics that confirms my belief that i was right to stand to offer myself up for election
while boris has many talents and attributes he wasn't capable of building that team and there were a number of people who had said to me during the course of the week michael
allow my colleagues in the conservative party to make a judgement about whether or not i am right to
over what happens within their own schools a greater degree of innovation and
to answer a few questions from david aronavitcher former colleague of mine at the times and also to
from a variety of state schools and members of the audience we're all passionate about making education
but i also like coming here because the students are so open and confident and polite and interesting and also the staff are
i think it's almost impossible when you're in the middle of making changes to know exactly what your legacy would be but i hope that my legacy would be more great teachers
huge day i always enjoy coming to wellington and there are a number of constituents of mine
people in political bureaucracies and they don't want to change because it suits them to deny
i've said that our young people just aren't cutting it when it comes to maths english and science so we need to change but there are
has a particular regard for us because he believes that he predicted brexit and at the time of that vote there were very few international figures who welcomed it as enthusiastically
the interview reflects a warm personal regard that the president has
i think he wants a strong relationship with britain he has an affection for britain his his
no i'm very happy being a member of parliament for sariheeth and a writer for the times but i think it's important to
but the times today carries that interview on its website in full and what we wanted to do is to make sure that people have the chance to hear
he is an electric personality you don't necessarily need to be a fan you don't need to suspect
wants to secure a trade deal and i know from the conversations that i had around my visit that when the foreign secretary went to talk to members of the trump team they enjoyed their conversations with him and they felt that he was an effective advocate for britain's interests and
i've i've been in government it's important to acknowledge as well that this was a shared interview it was
but donald trump had nothing but praise for theresa may in this interview wants to see
introduce were introduced in sweden in the 1990s after a recession and indeed in the aftermath of a banking crisis in sweden and yet they succeeded in making those reforms and i believe that we can hear and another critical thing about the sorts of reforms that we want to introduce is that by having new providers
at the moment is pretty bleak but one of the striking things is that the sorts of reforms that we want
one thing i would say however is that the fact the prime minister has answered the question the way that he has reminds everyone why he's our leader he's got the authority and he's
one of the ways in which it will help us win is that it reinforces in everyone's mind the fact that we have as our prime minister a normal sane decent guy who's in politics for the right reasons
and likes prime minister is people know that he is not interested in the office for what it can give him he's interested because of public service and he thinks two terms at the end of those two terms
during the course of any election you'll have all sorts of questions being asked about how long x is going to go
knows that one of the best ways in which you can establish your credentials for the top job is by continuing to be a loyal and effective member of the team and one of the
whom you've had to prize out of downing street their fingernails have been there in the doorjamb
to be a loyal number two but to be at the head of intrigue and that is not what we
the fact that the prime minister has answered a direct question honestly and you're in a state of cognitive dissonance
part of the meat and drink of political commentary what's really striking is that david has been honest today
answering a question directly as i have i've just said he's going to serve the full the full term the full five years and and i'm afraid
elected leader of the conservative party in the first place was because he was a breath of fresh air
clinton ronald reagan were strong executive leaders throughout their second term there is no reason why a british prime minister couldn't do exactly the same
as we saw last night the scale of what was happening and the fact that it was occurring on a to an extent that i don't think anyone anticipated placed a strain on the metropolitan police i think actually that officers behaved with amazing fortitude and resilience and courage but we needed more police on the streets
well there'll be time i think in due course for people to analyse what the specific factors were that led to the violence occurring in the way that it did but i don't believe that anyone anticipated that we would see violence on the scale that we have and the question now is that
to cause a greater degree of trouble than any of us could have envisaged so there is evidence and we are analysing what needs to be done but i think it's too soon to say that we have a total picture of what is inevitably a challenging situation that requires above all a security response
well you asked the question about disconnection i think that there will be time there has to be time for a proper examination of the factors that have led to the violence that's occurred
the leaflets that have been picked up that there may well be an element of
seek and to pursue should provide all of those who like me are angry at what happened with the reassurance of knowing that the prime minister is clear these people are criminals and they need to be caught prosecuted and jailed
