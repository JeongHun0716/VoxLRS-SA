i can do this this is ok so i i mull it over but because i'm a single mom i just really want to focus on her and make sure that i'm doing a good job first
because i was so kind of worried about the first and once she came i was like hey
i'm not it was a very weird thing i think he's very smart and funny and and and and i would date him but
i mean we went actually on a trip to see some ruins at the end of the island and you could just you
anyway and we went to austin texas and we got to fly i think you have the tornado clip we're like flying you know like it's very wizard of oz
me harm and hurt because he's adorable and i i am not otherwise you know taken in that way so it didn't cause harm and hurt but it
me because i was you know i was i know all the players so i wasn't confused the thing that
and all of the greek people were in the ocean nobody was in in athens at all they were all out on vacation they were just like all those tourists are coming we're leaving
she's like no i was like are you sure because it's ok i won't tell anyone
did a hollywood foreign press you know they run the golden globes and i did a press conference for this movie shark boy and i walked in and they said mazel tov and i was like
where they wrote that she gets set up on a blind date and she thinks it's with the man but in fact it's a woman when she gets there so the storyline is that she kisses the woman to see if she feels anything and the and the answer was no and i remember when we were doing the storyline and i was like
did i want to come so of course i said yes and then we went with the little group who was trying to campaign for new york and one of the reasons that we did was because we thought you know i think people in the world kind of don't realize how warm and multicultural new york is and we thought that it would be wonderful to combine the olympic world with kind of the new york that we know which is like you know every nationality we're not snobs you know we're very welcome
traumatized that they don't really want to live which is why the nursery is so important because there are other
i could give the green light right now i would i don't know why we're not making another one right this very second i hope we will i think there's you know weird things that go on with
i got her to daphne at the elephant nursery which is called the david sheldrick wildlife trust in nairobi and chaimu is now living a
that but there is i think there's two things there's a lack of awareness which is why
and they speak to each other with voices that sometimes are too low for us to even hear
programs with the community that we're working on where we're including them in the conservation of the parks because this really is their history and tradition
community keeps the fence hole keeps the bees makes money from selling the honey and it's kind of
daphne and the trust have raised 170 orphan elephants and rereleased them into the water
happening they might see an ivory bracelet and think isn't that pretty and buy it not knowing that this is actually driving elephants to extinction
three seconds the mother and the baby touch so when they see their whole family killed and their mother killed
i happened to be in the right place at the right time in 2009 and i found an orphan baby elephant chai moo
they really acclimate into another herd they create a herd of ex orphans which they didn't know would happen they didn't know what would happen when they started they don't really rerelease
we have a beekeeping situation which is really amazing because elephants are afraid of bees so we have this great program where the community
we love to see each other we're all doing well it's great but i think nothing in our careers really will live up
defend her friend in a way that we've never gotten gotten to see maybe a stronger maybe a little bit stronger
a very different tone you know we're all together for a lot of the movie as opposed to kind of being off in our own individual storylines we start off in new york in our
i think for for me and i think all of us the first couple days that we were in the sahara it was so surreal that it was almost hard to take in i mean you can see it on film but like the dunes just go on forever and just knowing that lawrence of arabia shot there and to think about us the four of us on camels in our outfits in the sahara desert like we just kept turning and taking pictures of each other
you know i mean i did have a stunt double thank goodness these camels are very very very high
i don't know it was just kind of a lot and it was i think our first or second day but it went well and then we put you know that man we fell on that man over and over again me and the stunt double he was a true
really higher than you expect so we had a stunt double but i still had to do it because you needed to seem real you know but i got to fall onto a mattress held by about eight men who didn't speak english they spoke french or they spoke arabic so there was some fear involved they were
probably had some kind of weird tennis shoe on when i was walking around going on my editions and i think they were just like who is this girl what is she wearing so for me it was not that different i was kind of jealous of sarah and
got to wear that crazy like mushroom looking wig but it was fun to do that and very real i rembember those days i remember walking to my waitressing jobs i remember my first apartment and i slept in the living room i had a roommate and for some reason she got the bedroom i mean it just comes flooding back
brad peyton is our director and he's very visual he's very visual it's interesting i mean i don't always get to work with directors like that because they usually do things like this which is not so much a female driven genre but he's he's very creative and visual and tuned in to kind of
dwayne's really really fun i think he's so different than i mean i don't really know what his perception is now because obviously he came from wrestling and then he's done action and then he's done more family fare and then he's done action but he's so
he's so down to earth he's so smart he has a great relationship with his mom i had to come down and study their relationship he's very
doing things differently in the visual world which is great for a 3d movie because i think you know
he's been working for a long time yet he has absolutely none of the qualities you would think of as someone who's grown up in the business
deliver that and at the same time he's really tuned into the relationships and the dialogue and you know he he's extremely patient and watchful and all the good things that you want in a director he's a sweetheart
you know you can be a kid one minute and be talking to adults the next but he's also just a sweetheart and pays attention
he's very self possessed without being precocious you know he doesn't ever have that strange thing like where he's been around adults all his life you know he can talk to
generous as a as a person and an actor and i'd met him before and i thought he wouldn't remember and he thought i wouldn't remember it was very funny but i'd met him before and he's very
