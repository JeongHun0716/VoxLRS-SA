know a hundred or whatever and and he's very funny but sometimes it's at the expense of other people
he's a he's a but you remember you're a really funny thing i'm you know if i tell it it's not gonna be that funny but tim does really funny things on the set like he's never been on a set before where he'll like bump into the boom with his head
enrichment of their lives so i do think there's a kind of a conundrum about australia and it would be nice if it could
because it is really a marked difference in terms of your global engagement with the refugees you know there's 60 million refugees in the world right now so it's a huge huge issue but i also understand you are an island nation i understand that there are certain realities to that in terms of refugees coming by boat
has a way that you can apply and you can get a small business loan or you can get a piece of land
unfortunately i think it was always happening and i think we weren't aware unfortunately i'm not an expert in terms of the history of it but i do feel now that people are talking about it and i think that's key
people forced to flee their home because of violence and then they're on the road without protection they're subject to horrible horrible things that i won't even recount for you but the stories that you hear are just you don't know how people survive what they go through
on a global front in terms of their support women in conflict livelihood building in congo in uganda you're a major player and it's really wonderful to see
but it's so wonderful that the humane society has this night and allows us to speak about our causes because you know that's all one can do really is try to support the people who do the real work
and you can adopt an elephant for $50 a year or a black rhino which are
it's hard to tell in a concise way but basically i've loved elephants my whole life
and big red gum it's very very intense and you have to load the gum properly
i mean it set me up well for my other job because it's so technical and strange like i actually i did well i was so happy to have them but one of my big ones was big red gum
yeah out there with the hammer myself i built a greenhouse and then i've been doing a lot of traveling with oxfam i've been to a number of countries in africa and really enjoyed that work
the kind of business model of having to open a film everywhere but we were most worried about new york and the fans here obviously it's our hometown
know nothing will ever be like this again and that's what was so incredible about getting to come back together because nothing is like our show and our movie so we're very
you know it's a day by day thing that you kind of feel connected to everybody else
to dinner on friday night in my neighborhood in new york which is a really not hip neighborhood and i thought you know i put on my hat i went out to dinner everything would be fine
where everybody was like oh you know what it's all hype it's all hype i mean there were really people who said that we were not going to be that successful and i just think it's very much um you know the people who do these kind of prognostications not taking the female
biggest every market in the world they are shocked they do not believe me but
to kind of shed light on things and tell stories in a way that people can relate
around it and also the environment that it lives in would not be deci
i mean first of all we were never apart from each other that whole time everyone thought we were but we weren't so that helps and then number two we've been doing this for ten years like it's
good place for a lot of reasons first of all it's nice to be a little older i know that might be strange to say in our culture but like you know when you're younger and you're striving and you don't know if you're going to make it and then we have this you know tremendous experience with sex and the city
thing is that like it does live on like whether we get to make a third or not i hope we do but if we don't it still lives on it's so great to be a part of something like that that you feel so proud of
i would go as far as hopeful i just wish i knew and could tell you actually something like substantial
i you know it's i mean i'm not her but i am her saying
so they did a very smart thing they're going to start with like kind of their favorite episodes not from the beginning so next week on the 15th starts their favorite episodes and they sent us i think five that they had done the editing on
love them so much they've totally changed me like when sarah jessica first got pregnant that was the question everyone kept saying to all of us is she totally different and i was like no what do you mean is she totally different she's always been maternal she's always been caretaking
so sometimes strange things would happen like the background would go
the good storylines and the good dialogue i don't think anyone would care what we were wearing and that's why i think we've been able to last and i think our fans are just so loyal and so kind of outspoken in a wonderful way and they just go with us where he thinks so hard and deep about what we should do and where we should go i mean like
and all of us have kept in touch no matter where we are or what coast or what country we're all in touch and therefore i didn't have the total withdrawal though i did have the sadness of not getting to be shooting on the streets and having that whole energy of being together and having that dialogue and having the fans be with us and i definitely missed that part
we start out in manhattan and we catch up with where the ladies lives are and
and we took pictures on the way down for a magazine and then i had just you have a really
i feel very worried about these people i feel heartened by the oxfam workers who are there already i'm in touch with them they're probably really sick of me now but i would love to go back i feel like there will be progress soon and i would love to be able to report back to everyone who's
and how it was escalating of the people flooding into the dadaab camp we were so close that we felt well we need to get up there we just really were unprepared for how really shocking it is
yes can i tell you that it is absolutely gonna happen on a certain date no we're not that close okay but i'm certainly
but i mean shooting here in new york it's kind of intense and we wear four inch heels all the time 18 hours
i wonder if anyone's gonna ask my opinion and then once we started discussing it they were all like would i do this or would i say this or would i do this or is this on right and then i was like oh god now i feel like i'm like i have all the pressure on me like i'm like like i have to represent all of america
i mean we have some vocal coaches but when we first started i was just like what are they doing
and then the woman can't let him go and becomes kind of a stalker and basically ruins our lives
situations around the world and get to see things that i would never have gotten to see
luckily you can often check back we have people with unhcr who are
displaced people in the world is an unprecedented number
i literally feel the same way but i personally totally enjoyed it now i'm wearing pants i'm the only lucky person to actually wear pants that day which helped a little bit but you know for me i mean i ride horses i'm good i like that stuff the walking in the sand was way harder than the camera that is hard
i mean it's soft sand for there's no during i'm trying to say it's not like our beaches or our dunes where like there's actually hard ground under there sarah's entire shoes were submerged i was really i mean she
and i thought it was perfectly in line with everything that we've done in the past and
you know but that's good it's good to have embarrassment factors like remember when i tap danced in the show same feeling about karaoke and tap dancing very embarrassing extremely hard i was very nervous i'm not the singer i'm the least
in terms of what i've watched my friends go through and certainly i have my own i mean
michael had talked to me about what he wanted to do this time we see each other all the time that we're not working
i mean there's some people who speak out you know it's one of those things too where my group in particular i came to my group because i found this orphan
there's a lot of people where they don't necessarily invest their time so much as maybe just lend their name here and there and i don't know that that's so helpful at this point
well it's not that far away from kristen's own 80s incarnation so in a way it was a bummer like i love everybody else's and when i saw them on film i mean i laugh so hard at cynthia especially but you know i wanted some wild wig or whatever but i'm a preppy what can i say i mean you know it's kind of timeless i thought it was more fun to get to do the crazy hair
we were there the whole time together you know it was we often have had i mean we've been
for her that that she can't live up to it that she can't even really admit it to herself and much less to her friends so that's how we find her at the beginning
to and he started talking to me about whatever the last episode was like details and i
no no no they understand that we're someone who wants to help but they don't have tv they don't have electricity usually but sometimes you'll be in a strange place like maputo mozambique and someone will come running down the street oh sex and the city and you're always like wow
and ben said hey you should call that actress and they were like what actress and i had been begging them please let me help please let me raise money and they were like oh no it's fine we're ok we're ok and then because of the crisis as well like right now we have 36 baby orphaned elephants in the nursery
little tiny babies which at the time that i found chaimu in 2009 they'd never had that many like it's been increasing increasing increasing so we've needed more funding and more funding and you know once i finally begged them enough they'd let me get out there and raise some money for them which was really a good feeling
you know i can't speak for everyone though you know i can almost speak for everyone to say yes i mean i think that we know that we were incredibly lucky to be a part of something that was so big and so wonderful and so beautifully written and that people
you know what i mean you i was building a house and i i'm very lucky that i make a lot of money obviously and life is good and you think like well
