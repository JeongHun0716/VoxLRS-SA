and our reality the material world and we've come so far in so many ways but i think jim is struggling to come to the
interesting and unique connection with him one that we maybe will wait our whole lives to try and have just a knowing they see the world the same way
to go around and discover all of these new kind of secret hidden and sometimes dark parts of los angeles that
of who am i what is my purpose in the world and what's real what's the really real and trying to find ways to
in a very strange way rid himself of as much as possible and playing
giant kong when there's really just like a pink x that i'm looking at but i was i was amazed by like how much i could believe and connect even though there was nothing there
i think i was just more surprised by like how far your imagination can take you you don't know until you kind of push yourself to the limit i am used to working with more tangible things working with a scene partner but there's a lot of my job that's always been make believe this was just like way more extreme of course you know i'm trying to pretend that there's
you know i'm a big believer in storytelling and it's a form of activism for me and i'm just excited that i can make movies that are about things that are really important that ask really big questions and i get to do it in a fun movie with 3d glasses like that's my that's been my dream and i'm getting to live that dream
i had taken a photography class years ago and then with this movie i thought well i'm in these incredible locations my subjects are like these amazing actors that are going to be great to take photos of and it was just a way to get closer to who mason is and what she's looking for and how she observes people and then on top of it i got some cool behind the scenes photos
i feel bad saying it because it's like oh it's not like magical it's not like fairies follow me around everywhere i go now but
i think it might be i have been kind of wondering what i'm supposed to do with all of them at this point
to people been like i don't know what to do i don't know what to do and you're like just go just go and you're like i don't know which way to run like that's a problem
not what's happening right now i'm not and he was like i'm watched her on the field it's like i just threw a football for the first time there's no way that you like thought that i was like joking he thought that maybe i was joking to like trip up the other team but i really was just that bad i see it wasn't a move of any kind
and i was like oh it's before the football game it's before the super bowl they're not gonna actually have us play it's just gonna be like us talking and a camera kinda going around being like we're here and i didn't realize until i got there and they like handed me a jersey that i was like oh no and
i have this weird dream that there's some weird cave somewhere where if i place them all together like something magical happens like maybe they all fit together like indiana jones
hey you know how this moment she could look inside of himself and go should i run with this and look at me but he ended up just running immediately got tackled we lost the game and he was so sad the whole time he was like i knew larson was a secret weapon i really screwed that up it was like oh yeah you really screwed that one up
choked on these chips yesterday and i was like no no no this is how i'm gonna go but a words i go with that
makes molly feel very comfortable and he seems to be the only person in the school that is exactly who he says he is
he's so funny and charming and is really good at throwing parties and having a good time and
i play molly tracy who is jonah's character's love interest i guess that seems fair it feels weird to say that about him i don't know what he would say about me
to have watched the show before if anything i think it's an exciting chance to modernize something that was so good before that is then going to open a door for other people young people to see it i think that's it's always exciting to have something new that allows you to go backwards
i guess the molly eric relationship is the modern day version of of the typical going steady
i think that the concept is the same but the story and the people involved is completely different so i don't think it's necessarily important
and molly are both drawn to his his charisma and he's different and he's also so smart you know so many things we not not realizing that he's older and therefore of course he knows all these cool references that we don't know about like rain man what is rain man we're both like completely astounded
because we know what the outside world is like this is what they know and so this is their home
you're stuck in room and you know that you have a predator coming in every night
well it's finding a way to actually work with old nick instead of just
of the children and and that you've seen on the news but i do know that if for us room became a canvas for our imagination
gills that i was able to take into making room to make sure that i never got too deep it never went too dark and you can find ways to
to me but through the experience of traveling with it to different countries talking about it with different people i could see how this same allegory could mean something completely different to somebody else and finding all of these small new meanings in it has been such an incredible discovery along the way
of new talent coming in has been incredible it feels like
with conflict on set through humor that are much harder to deal with if you take them seriously so they've both been incredibly important to me in the way that their processes have given me so much and got me closer to myself
but laughter and tears are both release and they're both incredibly valuable i've learned so much from from amy and from judd and from bill about how humor is so important as a way of release but i do love crying too so there will always be both
i filmed trainwreck before rome and so trainwreck was this wonderful
being out in the world and seeing how a piece of art like this connects with so many people although the fame part is a little scary it's also quite warm and welcoming you feel like you have a friend wherever you go and someone to connect with
goodbye i guess to one type of being and i learned and really refined my sense of humor through that process and realized how valuable it was and it was those
