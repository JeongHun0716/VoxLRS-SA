subsequently or then followed by a deep sneeze because i get really bad hay fever
if you've done something during the day and you then have to compartmentalize it to going to the next part of the day to start afresh
and it kind of opens up a story of good versus evil a much more epic story
rowling's imagination like getting to kind of delve back into that world the world that she created with the harry potter film
but it's set in the 1920s so it's all about world but in this kind of different era different period so it's great
something that as she's beginning to transition it's finding comfort in herself and finding herself and when i felt like i'd begun to discover her smile that was a wonderful breakthrough
thank you mate for me finding lily in this film was about finding her smile and that being
i mean i saw it in imax one of the first times and you can literally sort of trace it's like dot to dot on my freckles it becomes like a kind of
taught me so it was a bit of an education it's one of the great things about my job is you get educated in weird and wonderful parts of
of technology and lights and things with art and the known and the unknown it's how those two things collide and you never know whether they're going to work i suppose in some ways it's like steve and pinchey
do you know what i was pretty ignorant and the whole experience has been and it's been three or four years that i've been attached to the film and learning but some of the most simple things were perhaps the most i couldn't believe that i didn't know like the idea that
wha ahh thanks thank you for making me sweat
i suppose the moment that i feel and it's nothing compared to
quick answer no no and it's that hilarious thing by which when before you're a parent you sort of hear people talking about
yeah so we which was so we had this fan event for fantastic beasts and we were all there and then
o'clock in the morning and you go in and you're sort of gently furious and then you get a little smile and your heart breaks a bit and it's totally worth it
she was so calm i was holding for a bit while she was being really calm and she cried and i
extraordinary imaginations and when i read this script it was sort of it was it was like going into another entire world and the process of making it was wondrous and fun and freeing and so i hope it will certainly be on it will be unlike anything i've ever done and i hope it'll be a crazy
all the photos i could find of stephen when he was younger and tried to work out with the specialist what his unique decline would have been and then i worked with a dancer to help try and find that in my body and i suppose the last aspect was then meeting stephen and jane and jonathan and the children and really getting a sense of their personality
no but we were at the same school together as well we basically yeah we got a long way
no i mean i sang when i was a kid i'd done maybe i think i did a production of cabaret when i was at school but i'd never done anything on screen like it or anything professionally really so
i'd taken that for granted quite how enduring it is but it was wonderful
getting to watch channing and mila work they're like channing well he had to learn to rollerblade for this film he's a proper movie star through and through and the physical work he had to do i think sometimes
and i did i loved the lion king when i was younger and i had a weird obsession with nala
but i do love the idea some other people have also gone you know will you method on this have you become brighter since doing it
a sort of extension of your body because you are unable to move certain things and so there's a very intimate dance that happens and so felicity who's an old friend she and i had worked for several weeks at all the different stages of the film trying to make sure that there was this kind of symbiosis between the two of us but no no people
of cramp without you getting spasms because when you're filming you have to sustain those positions for
i will never forget i was sort of whining about something one day and i think michelle was like
or i would type swear words into his voice machine and press play on repeat and that was so important because until then i was wanting to be absolutely respectful but forgetting that there was this one gentleman i met who had als who the morning i met him the night before he had gone to er having almost genuinely
and she was wonderful and her book was a bit of a you know i had to be careful because i was also very protective of steven's point of view so i was reading all of his material and he had written an autobiography that came out around the same time as we started filming but certainly her book in its intricacy and its detail was really important as far as playing a superhero
it was about i always saw the painting somehow as a routine it was as if she needed to sort of shed some of that restriction to find who she was
i arrived to meet him and there was this very unique rhythm this kind of long long pauses
and we were just incredibly inappropriate and we were so sort of wanted to meet her that we just sort of literally stalked about four meters behind her for an entire evening and eventually i think she was like ok what what what
was the very first scene that we shot and that was him sort of young and healthy but then that afternoon
some kids came to visit the set when we were filming and because they build so much of it and so many of the
or let me take a bit of time off and it's been amazing i love time off
this was shop and i'd just go and look through the window it was where you bought proper magic kit you'd buy the wherewithal to sort someone in half and anyway so when i used to go and stay with my grandmother i'd be like she lives in edinburgh and we'd go can we go and find magic shops when i got cast in this no one was more excited than my grandmother who was like i don't want to
and she is incredibly passionate about it and i can't think of two more passionate people to take those stories and take them out into
catherine's character with tina it's a sort of slow build connection these two people who are outsiders and yet passionate people sort of begin
you gently start sweating i think also because we are all fans of the films the potter films you're like your own harshest critic it was so wonderful to delve back into jk rowling's world at this different time but you want it to be wonderful
i found ian holm who'd played it in lord of the rings and i tried to copy his character and
suits and it for me it read as almost like a an exoskeleton like kind of scaffolding propping up this sort of masculine
everything you can and so that's kind of how i went about it but it was important for me to meet people from different generations because when
lily story and gerda's story which is an incredibly powerful love story questioning the fact that love is about the soul it's not about sexuality it's not about gender
being trans and what that is like and it continues to bring up the conversations that need to happen about discrimination about abuse about health care all of those and i hope it continues that dialogue which is so sort of rife at the moment because they're still along
and she helped me sort of train a bit like an athlete train your muscles to be able to sort of stay in these positions for extended periods and at moments it was complicated but also every day you were aware that you could get up at the end of the day and many of the people that i met who lived with als
science fiction and original and something kind of weird shakespearean and greek and i have no idea how they've managed to meld all those worlds what they have
