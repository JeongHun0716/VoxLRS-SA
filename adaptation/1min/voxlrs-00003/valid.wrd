but we have a chance this year to have another 1984 it seems to me these people are high stakes and something could happen particularly in the first debate that upsets this race pretty dramatically
the most recent poll there shows mason dixon shows a two point lead for clinton but if you look at the other two polls there one shows a two point lead for trump florida atlantic university and a one point lead for trump the florida chamber of commerce but those are
but not necessarily in more than one state he sort of made the bet that he's going to try and be he's going to be the guy who he's counting on trump collapsing and him inheriting his people which is why he doesn't say things bad things about him goes out of his way to say i'm saying nice things about him it's pretty cynical and i suspect that trump has got that this is a guy who really does it who's counting on him
republicans are not going to win this next election by finding a missing magic cash of conservative voters who have heretofore loyally supported us but were turned off by those arch liberals john mccain and mitt romney that simply is a myth it's sort of like trying to refight the civil war as a lost cause
but there are candidates who can plausibly win the nomination bush
to defeat donald trump they know that's never going to happen it just is not going to happen it is more insidious and more dangerous in a way and that is to undermine the people's ongoing confidence in the presidentelect now i've been through this once before i remember people like paul begala and others out there in 2000 and 2001 saying george bush is not a
i have no idea well look we know where these things come from these come from the nationalists the populists inside the white house who say we've got to do something to increase jobs and the way we do that is a big makework project we've got to increase spending on infrastructure look i'm a little bit conflicted on this my fatherinlaw has been the head of the white house
will i think look there's a good chance we don't and it's because you've got that's a disaster
end of september and it had a 20% increase in discretionary spending the republicans blocked him from passing a full year budget trump comes in and what does trump do he says more defense more homeland security less on things that i'm not in favor of
first of all let me say i enjoyed the segment with you and judge napolitano where he questioned your accent we understand you down here just absolutely crystal clear it's napolitano
the president has the biggest megaphone and if we want the focus to be on jobs and the economy and prosperity and making the country move again he needs to set the tone and instead it's so personal with him you were talking about commencement addresses well
he had a right to re to to fire jim comy and rod rosenstein the deputy attorney general laid out excellent reason
yeah look let me go back for a second they did have talking points i got a copy of them but the question is whether they got them into time and when they had
the labor department regulations and other regulations had a serious impact and obamacare of course ripping up their balance
i'm going to keep going fine but i'll be happy to answer the question please do look i thought he'd get close i thought he would win florida i thought he'd win
and it wasn't until 2012 after he'd lost control of the house was in a reelection battle and had little enthusiasm for him his campaign and the latino immigration community that he finally issued the daca order
and sort of tried to make it the summer of his campaign a big deal so the president has a little bit president obama has a little bit of a weird relationship to this issue he claims to be an advocate but when he had a chance to do something about it he didn't
of paid family leave they stood up and applauded on nato they joined in when they should
well you know what i've got to check the chart and see what it takes to put personal references to other pundits in my column there's a chart i have to have to check on that i'll let you know what the bill is and send it to you
and you could tell it affected his delivery a little bit he started reading almost exclusively from the panel to his left which allowed him to look at the right side of the chamber which were the republicans but the democrats you're right they stood up and applauded
been waiting on average 230 days to get a determination whether or not they were eligible and covered by the va
991 one of the reasons why is one of the biggest blocks of votes out in the state are the republican suburbs inside hamilton
presidential elections we had one where they were tied on labor day 2002 obama won one where somebody was behind george w bush in 2000 and went on to win but in the other seven elections
then the best thing for him and for the president is for him to say mr president better that you never ask me those kind of questions better that you never raise the issues in that way so if it was in the gray area he had an obligation to say something to the president i think if it was not in the gray area and it had crossed his line then he had an obligation to say something inside
incorrect or improper to be asked that he should have said to the president mr president with all due respect i don't
he said in that conversation do you think he could let this thing with flynn go we don't know whether or not it's accurate that the way that comey remembers it is accurate but it would seem that if the president said that and comey
if it was improper for president trump to say in the oval office hey let this thing go i think you have to apply that same standard and say it was inappropriate for the former president to while he was in office while the investigation is underway to say hey she hasn't done anything wrong in essence signaling to the fbi drop it
about items to go in the stimulus bill and he cut them off by saying i won basically shut up i won sit down this set a bad tone and this tone has continued and a president has to be open to and legislators have to be open to reasonable compromises recognizing the ideological constraints of their party and the nature of the of the city
we've always had strongly ideological figures in congress ted kennedy for example and barry goldwater
so people can take their benefits with them from job to job and not be stuck in a job they hate for fear of losing their job
in the last three years the tone that the president has said have made this more difficult when the president in early
effort by democrats starting on july 15th of 2003 to say bushlight about wmd in iraq the first five people to make that charge and the 15th it was
i understand why arizona did it because it's the weak point on the border and they've got all kinds of problems with drug related primarily drug related violence
but even he said some of it at wmd and was a threat he said we can just take care of it by something short of four
in the primary and having the support of the president of the united states helps you there
really good i mean that said the book has done quite well the publisher is very happy with it
well bush deserved to be impeached over there what did bob graham deserve to have happen to her so to me it was one of the great i mean it was so cynical in a time of war let's undermine confidence in the commander in chief so we can win election i thought it was despicable
this could be career people at the at either in the national security council or the state department who might have access to this as well
entirely there's another part of the new york times story though that is troubling
that was do you think he was trying to pressure you to drop the investigation and if
great pressure because of russia and that's taken off that's sort of like the
us you know it's discouraging and demoralizing
you know don't be very careful with the president's credibility and don't create moments you go in and talk to chuck schumer and nancy pelosi and say i won the popular vote except for those illegal aliens of course they're going to go mock you to the press
and then we had an interesting moment in the communications world where sean spiljak
is that you got it all wrong i mean you know for example that last one that was actually a nutty college
iraqis had attempted to acquire uranium cake in fact we now know that he brought back information not disclosed in his article that added to the belief that confirmed the british intelligence report that the iraqis had attempted to acquire uranium cake he brought back information about a previously unknown contact where the iraqis working through a third
but my recollection is that i said i heard that too
one of the interesting stories is going to be why at this moment and it may have been that this was the only moment that you know they may have been boxed in by the rest of the nato leaders so this was the only moment where the president had the stage to himself i'm sure that he would have preferred to have said this it's something other than a memorial to victims of 911 and you know it looks sort of odd
a 911 vote difference 4917
when it was at 74% it was 20 some odd thousand votes now with 77% of the vote in it is 991 one of the reasons why it's one of the biggest blocks of votes out in the state are the republican suburbs inside hamilton county
and for example right now we just showed 22 million or so thereabouts for each one of these guys the secretary of state shows 2473492 for obama to 2443901 for romney now the gap which was 911 whenever this
even if they have made it on the basis of select precincts i'd be very cautious about intruding in this process
that'd be about a million two people out if you look at cuyahoga county 414000 votes have already been cast last time around 668000 were cast so somewhere around 260000 votes would still come out of cuyahoga county
supposed pseudo cage match began is now 29906 for president obama but it's you know we still have 700000 votes or more likely to count and so the question was at a point when the secretary of state's website was saying 911 votes difference we were raising the cautionary note whether it might have been wise just to wait a little
let's go back why was this why why did the space cowboys raise the issue because at the time that we did it the numbers being shown on the fox
425000 were cast last time around about 220 yet to be cast in that case
to let us have two of the morally unfit people i mean this is the kind of guy he is
this is what caused the senate democrats to lose their majority in 2014 it is a good thing for american democracy that this man is retiring to searchlight nevada it's not too soon for me january 4th can't arrive too early for harry reid to hit the road
and the explosion of social media which is created if you will a class of people inside the united states who are focused on receiving information up to date uh ed realtime and are engaged in this the question is how much of
he said he said moment but let's assume for a moment that president trump said
when it was at 74% it was 20some odd thousand votes
it is 991 one of the reasons why is one of the biggest blocks of votes out in the state are the republican suburbs inside
secretary of state website i got the director of the ohio campaign harami on the other end of the line refreshing the page every few seconds and this went from being
and we now are starting to see the suburbs start coming in then we have big swatches of butler county delaware county
let me let me just say it wasn't the clinton people it was the gore people and i'm confident the president obama's staff is not going to uh stoop to that president clinton i suspect was horrified when he found out what some people had done
we shared common friends so that when he would come to the white house we'd chitchat about those common friends
to subsidize their lifestyle and to put themselves in a place where it looks like a conflict of interest
he was so it was so totally unexperienced totally unqualified and immediately was forced to resign but what was he this year he was a super delegate for hillary in philadelphia
well it's not unusual for somebody to spend a considerable block of time with the president but i think there are very few presidents who spend hours with somebody in the oval office particularly a blowhard like joe biden was i mean this guy is i've seen him in some meetings when he came to the white house
absolutely absolutely there would be a note taker in the room i thought it was interesting andy card who was the chief of staff said he
this whole issue of calling states on the basis of exit polling is something that needs to be taken
or maybe they were quoting some of these same three people twice and one person defended the process
now fleshing it out matters but they said let's emphasize prosperity what have we done to
let's talk about us following through on what we said during the campaign put in a rule for
look he has done really well in these meetings with foreign leaders what i hear back from the foreign affairs community is that most of these foreign leaders say wow i had a productive meeting
the leaks against the administration i counted up in one washington post story 11 negative quotes about things going on in the west wing from 9 at least 9 staffers in the west wing and then we got of course friends some of them who are real friends and some of them who are styled as friends who are
if he ever gets the credit for that all right karl grove thank you very much my friend have a safe weekend
during the primary season we had all these candidates herman cain looked great rick perry
