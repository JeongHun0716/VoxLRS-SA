learned everything in that year and it takes immersion and total immersion of course is a crucial part of that i also had wonderful experience of studying with arlene o'shea great american soprano who gave me so much and was so extraordinary as a teacher along with fantastic coaches and
within six months of course i felt a tremendous amount of comfort it took that long really to feel comfortable in the language one of the things i love now is that having that foundation in the language and also studying lidr all
you're filling out an application you're doing your best be imaginative try to challenge yourself in terms of what it is you're setting out to do and
as opposed to simply being from one place i mean i never left this country really until i was in my 20s until i had this grant so it's in for a young person who's from somewhere where they don't have the opportunity to travel like my children have with me it's an amazing gift
need to concentrate more on the psychological drama and what's happening between these characters
i'm really grappling with this issue what in life is important what are should my priorities be right now
hugely because it it made me sort of unhappy i mean you can't win approval from everyone all the time and if you need it all the time then obviously you're not very ha
it it was through my own inability to say no and my own inability
fortunately i i think i do but i do a little better now maybe not a lot better but a little bit
am i giving my children enough time or
smoke in the bathroom wear nylons and get in girl fights there were these girls who would fight in my junior
i woke up one day and said this has been fun i i've accomplished a lot i've done a lot already in my life and i really want to look for a teaching job in some place and and live quiet and and raise my children and and be a mom
my schedule to a a reasonable place there was one year it was not a year it was actually 13 month period in which i was scheduled to sing 10 new roles
and i would literally befriend people who didn't have that constraint to try and learn about them and try and
graduate of the this school who was expecting a baby
when people said where do you like to sing the most i always said the met because it was my home
long gregarious experiencer of new thing
soprano they're young women you know they're sort of between the ages of 17 and 25 and so even if my voice can still sing these roles really well which some of them i can still sing it's sort of
when you start out the ambition is powerful and it's a driving force and you have a lot to accomplish and and to get there
the physical resilience so if i sing a big performance i don't want to do it again the next day you know it's like we are the weightlifters of singers and so that's
i i think it's it's a really wonderful place to be to begin to think about okay what do i want to do now
to achieve and to get better is also sometimes telling you you're not good enough
heard about the the you mentioned that the sports connection i think a lot about the olympics and how people keep breaking records and and and are there more violinists you think who can play with that sort of
born too soon but but he was the ultimate virtuoso and by virtuoso i think that someone not just has a good technique and plays everything perfectly someone that tosses it off like it's easy
listen a lot to the performances of chrysler paganini did you think a lot about their performances did you carry them with you on stage are they a are they a burden are they
you're about to play one of my favorite songs and one of the great great songs in all of the literature none but the lonely part of tchaikovsky and i was wondering if you think about singers do you think about breathing you
but i've lived with these pieces enough that i sort of feel like i own them now
of it out at the amount of notes you play at the the perfection and the intonation of it what is your relationship to virtuosity in general
and he wrote music that celebrated the instrument and and saintsans did the same actually saintsans wrote the introduction to rondo capricciosa for sarasate who was sort of the successor to paganini and he was another one of the great ricciosas but i listened to them as a as a kid
he was had the charm of chrysler i've never heard anyone with that and and so i'll never live up obviously playing his music to him but but but that so it's not all about all about just the athletic athletic nature of playing music it's just a small part of it as you know
in that moment we're being judged we see that as so negative in a sense when in fact the minute you're on the other side even in the audience even when i'm in the audience we're well intentioned
mix up high that that i find dangerous if you don't know how to do it
then you can be helped with it but i can't do it for instance i i have no idea i have a break and then
you don't push it out because that's another problem it will collapse but slow
if you if you if somebody sees you and you do a big gesture on that top note or you do something that's suddenly where it doesn't feel comfortable or it sounds tight or feels tight then it's too much anything up to that is probably great
classically trained singers i think for us it's so risky we tend if we have have swollen folds we tend not to to we tend to cancel
good yeah so you always want that total expansion and the mistake we make
windy day and everybody's clothing everything is flying all over my hair never moved not a single
of volume but as actors one of the problems too is that everybody needs to sing in a more popular
singing a long phrase or a high phrase or we're thinking about power is to collapse all that
which makes for a harsh sound or a tense sound or a strident sound
that's why it's not just lower breath it's also the rib cage so for me
help anybody if you can't perform when the time comes so that's that's really the secret
i have to very much avoid loud places i have to be careful about going to restaurants going to places where there's a
when he was practicing and he said renee you have to teach me how to sing
